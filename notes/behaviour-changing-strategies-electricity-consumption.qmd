Status: Rough draft!

Two key trends offer an extraoridinary oppertunity for thinking about strategies for changing or helping people change their electricity consumption habits. First, the energy-crises means that prices are increasing and will fluctuate more often due to supply and demand.  Second, the climate-crisis mean that more and more people share an interest in changing their ecological footprint and change their consumption behaviour^[I assume that young adults and families with kids have a vested interest in climate action. According to the Danish Statistical Service there are [773541 families with children](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/nyheder-analyser-publ/nyt/NytHtml?cid=37837) and [786807 young adults (20-29)](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/selectvarval/define.asp?MainTable=FOLK1A&PLanguage=0&Tabstrip=&PXSId=0&SessID=407298487&FF=20&grouping3=201676131924174402396&tfrequency=1) in Denmark. That's a lot of people!]. That means that there are a lot of people who want to participate in understanding and changing their consumption habits -- some motivated by economy and some by a moral standpoint.

At the same time, energy producers, grid companies and energy providers are investing billions into Smart grid solutions -- using digitization, modelling, prediction etc. to make the best out of the current grid infrastructure in order to supply and increased demand. There are two key challenges: Dirst, switching to green energy mean changes in the supply side -- energy when the wind is blowing and sun is shining -- that does not always fit demand. Second, challenges on the demand side. Just like traffic there are peak consumption, in particular from households. We use power when we get up in the morning and when we come home and cook dinner. This consumption pattern is not as flexible as we imagine -- kids go to school at the same time and most families have to cook between 17 - 19. Generally speaking, out habits are collective. And it might worsen when everyone switches to electrical cars -- what happens when everyone return home and plug in their EV at the same time? Peak is gonna happen. And peak is bad -- the energy need surges and the infrastructure is struggling to meet the demands at the neccesary throughput.

## So, what can we do about it?

Personally, I think a lot can be done (and a lot is being done). The smartgrid efforts will likely optimize our infrastructure as best as possible (save [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) and [Khazzoom-Brookes postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazzoom%E2%80%93Brookes_postulate)^[Goes something like "" .see also[Fich et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/16/5821)] or )

See also[Fich et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/16/5821)]). Still, there are lot of strategies to visit and revisit on the consumer side, in particular for households (to address the peak-problem) and small and medium sized business (SMVs).
