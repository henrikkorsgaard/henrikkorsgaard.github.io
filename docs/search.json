    "text": "Status: Rough draft!\nI am trying to understand and explore aspects of the peak-demand problem, in particular within the electricity grid from a household perspective. Peak-demand is when there is the highest amount of demand on the electricity system. This is typically when a large amount of consumers need energy at the same time. One famous example is the TV-surge in the UK, where there is a significant increase in demand created by people putting over a kettle as TV-shows end. The peak-demand problem introduces two1 related problems, that go into effect depending on local conditions. So, with this reference, I have tried to sketch peak versus non-peak below.\nFirst, peak-demand create a need for increasing production of energy. In traditional systems, the increase in demand might be anticipated and production can be increased. In systems that are based on unstable sources of energy (wind, sun, water), this can become a problem where auxiliary production is needed (peak power stations). Second, peak-demand introduces an increased load on the grid – for both transimission and local distribution. This increases the strain on the grid and transformer stations, and the local grid. While the kettle might introduce a significant increase already, I assume the problem will worsen if everyone come home and plug in an Electrical Vehicle (EV) at the same time (and we do not have an intelligent response in the grid and household). EVs draw significantly more power than kettles.\nI do not yet know if the peak demand problem is mostly challenging production or distribution. This likely depend on the local infrastructure, energy sources and demand patterns."

I have not considered increasing the capacity of the grid or production, as this makes little sense strategically (see Jevons Paradox and Khazzoom-Brookes postulate2)).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Peak options: a. Peak; b. Remove peak consumption; c. Move peak consumption; d. Stretch or soften peak (flatten the curve!)\n\n\nWe have three options:\n\nRemove peak consumption: Construct some intervention that remove the peak consumption. If I stop cooking my meals and just eat a sandwhich for dinner, then I’ve removed some consumption.\nMove peak consumption: Move the consumption to another time. If I start eathing dinner outside peak-hours, e.g. at 21, I have effectively removed (my consumption) from peak.\nDistribute consumption: Consider interventions that distributes the local consumption to flatten peak. This could be cooking earlier and then just reheat at dinner time.\n\nNow, there are two considerations here. First, the peak I showed above is my peak consumption. That is only important if it coincide with peak consumption in the part of the grid I’m part of (see figure 1). Second, and implied, moving can then either be considered a question of chaging my behaviour entirely or being flexible on a collective level. That is, I get to keep my peak consumption, I just have to move it."

    "text": "Status: Rough draft!\nTwo key trends offer an extraoridinary oppertunity for thinking about strategies for changing or helping people change their electricity consumption habits. First, the energy-crises means that prices are increasing and will fluctuate more often due to supply and demand. Second, the climate-crisis mean that more and more people share an interest in changing their ecological footprint and change their consumption behaviour1. That means that there are a lot of people who want to participate in understanding and changing their consumption habits – some motivated by economy and some by a moral standpoint.\nAt the same time, energy producers, grid companies and energy providers are investing billions into Smart grid solutions – using digitization, modelling, prediction etc. to make the best out of the current grid infrastructure in order to supply and increased demand. There are two key challenges: Dirst, switching to green energy mean changes in the supply side – energy when the wind is blowing and sun is shining – that does not always fit demand. Second, challenges on the demand side. Just like traffic there are peak consumption, in particular from households. We use power when we get up in the morning and when we come home and cook dinner. This consumption pattern is not as flexible as we imagine – kids go to school at the same time and most families have to cook between 17 - 19. Generally speaking, out habits are collective. And it might worsen when everyone switches to electrical cars – what happens when everyone return home and plug in their EV at the same time? Peak is gonna happen. And peak is bad – the energy need surges and the infrastructure is struggling to meet the demands at the neccesary throughput."

The smartgrid efforts will likely optimize our infrastructure as best as possible (save Jevons Paradox and Khazzoom-Brookes postulate2). Still, there are lot of strategies to visit and revisit on the consumer side, in particular for households (to address the peak-problem) and small and medium sized business (SMVs).\nGiven the number of consumers interested in contributing, I think a user-centered approach should supplement the producer- and grid-centered (system-centered) approach. And to develop successful intervention, we need to consider it as a partnership with empasis on dialogue and mutual learning. This points to participatory and co-design approches. But before we go into that, we need to examine the existing strategies."

    "text": "Understanding different strategies\n\n\n\nSketch: Strategies for changing consumption behaviour\n\n\nIn the figure above, I have tried to sketch a intervention space and plot in different strategies. There are five strategies3. Each strategy have a role to play, but operates with different assumptions and effects. I have split the space into a producer- and consumer side; and user-centered and system-centered approches.\n\nNothing (or optimizing the Smart Grid)\nThe first one is the current dominant strategy in terms of research, development and investment. The consumers will consume, while the producers and grid operators invest deeply into optimizing the infrastructure and production to meet changing demands.\nThe orientation toward the consumer, is as a consumer, and the efforts to understand consumption behaviour is approached from the perspective of understanding the consumption in the grid and modelling consumer behaviour as group behaviour (cittion needed). As said, this is a very important effort, but it will not provide the gains needed without other efforts.\n\n\nRegulating consumption through pricing\nAnother common and current strategy is to regulate energy-consumption is through dynamic pricing. As the energy market changes, so does the consumer pricing. A more recent initiative in Denmark, is to increase the price between 17 and 20, in hopes that this will motivate consumers to move their flexible consumption to another hour (citation needed). This is clearly to address the peak-problem.\nThe is an effective strategy, because we know that economic incentives work (citation needed). However, while this strategy likely impacts all consumers, it will affect low-income groups more (citation needed). And since only a marginal part of the consumption (laundry) is flexible, it is hard to move a significant amount of consumption, unless skipping hot meals and turning of the refrigerator.\n\n\nNudging consumers\nThe pricing model described above will incentify consumers to change some of their behaviour. A popular term for this is to ‘nudge’ consumers. That is to use means to manipulate consumers into changing their behaviour. I have seperated this strategy from the above, because pricing is unavoidable, whereas nudging is a strategy that can be initiated in addition. Nudging can come in the form of reminders, competition, awards etc. geared toward promoting specific behaviours. It is different from education and information-driven intiatives, because the consumer does not neccesarily need to know or link the aspects of the nudging-campain with the intended behaviour change.\nFrom the figure, we can notice that the nudging strategy have moved from the producer side to the consumer side. Whereas pricing is set at the producer side, nudging initiatives are most powerful within the context where the behaviour-change need to happen.\nResearch on nudging and energy https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300383\n\n\nInformation\nOn the user-centered side we have strategies that focus on providing target information and advice for consumers.\nParagraf 14\n\n\nConsultancy"

    "text": "When I pay for electricity I pay one month in advance based on my estimated consumption and the estimated market price on electricity. If I consume more or less, or if the prices are higher or lower than expected, the difference in payment is adjusted for the coming months. Roughly translated, my bill looks something like this:\n\n\nDear customer\n\n\nIt is time to pay for your electricity at Denmarkstreet 10, 8100 Aarhus\n\n\n\n\n\nYour prepayment for the next period: 01.07.2022 – 31.07.2022\n\n\n\n\n\nWe estimate that you will use\n\n\n305.649 kWh\n\n\n1151.01 DKK\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consumption includes subscribtion and fixed fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour statement from last period: 01.06.2022 – 30.06.2022\n\n\n\n\n\nWe estimated you to use\n\n\n315.096 kWh\n\n\n1182.98 DKK\n\n\n\n\nYou used\n\n\n316.802 kWh\n\n\n1189.07 DKK\n\n\n\n\nDifference to be paid\n\n\n\n\n6.09 DKK\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consumption includes subscribtion and fixed fees.\n\n\nYour total payment (including vat) 1157.11 DKK\n\n\nNotice that you may experience a small difference between the totals and sums of each item, because the calculation is done using more decimal places than reflected on the bill.\n\n\nFrom a everyday case of interacting with data (and from a data design perspective), there are quite a few things to unpack. Let’s invent some design principles1.\n\nFirst principle: If you present the user with a prediction about consumption you have to explain the basis of that prediction.\nWhy? Because that will ensure transparency and allow the consumer to engage with the data, seek out more information and potentially use the information to act in their best interest. Secondly, one could argue that the right to an explanation is in effect here, given that there are financial implications, but that is just a detail.\nNow, what do the provider give in terms of information about the estimation? From the bill and the website, we learn that it is based on “my expected consumption and the expected price per kWH for the next period.” This is supplemented by a general statement about recent increase in prices and consumption: “if you experience your bill to be higher than usual in the coming montsh, it is because the prices on electricity has gone up in the last months. The winter season also impact your consumption leading to a higher electricity bill”\nWe do learn that the bill combines two estimates. They estimate my consumption and then the electricity price one month out. The first – consumption – I should be able to influence, so lets take a look at that. I went through all my bills back to April 2020 when they introduced the estimate model and collected the data.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nactual2021 = np.array([302.024,308.978,266.689,332.947,317.887,299.468,333.479,360.479,406.004])\npredicted2021 = np.array([288.835,290.35,257.746,274.158,317.961,314.396,383.261,380.969,422.834])\nactual2022 = np.array([413.49,347.342,342.519,321.065,335.04,316.802,254.906,308.2,280.031,294.629, 307])\npredicted2022 = np.array([430.406,364.626,354.423,340.85,330.57,315.096,305.642,309.731,313.22,336.317, 347.14])\n\nx2020 = np.arange(9)\nx2021 = np.arange(11)\n\nfig,axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10,5))\nfig.suptitle(\"Electricity consumption: Predicted (blue) versus actual (green) consumption\")\n#fig.ylabel(\"Kwh per month\")\n\naxes[0].plot(x2020, actual2021, color=\"green\")\naxes[0].plot(x2020, predicted2021, color=\"blue\")\naxes[0].set_ylabel(\"Kwh per month\")\naxes[0].set_xticks(np.arange(9), [\"Apr\",\"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\"])\naxes[0].set_title(\"2021\")\n\naxes[1].plot(x2021, actual2022, color=\"green\")\naxes[1].plot(x2021, predicted2022, color=\"blue\")\naxes[1].set_ylabel(\"Kwh per month\")\naxes[1].set_xticks(np.arange(11), [\"Jan\",\"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\"])\naxes[1].set_title(\"2022\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis indicates that the estimation is not particularly accurate. The example bill from June 2022 above is one of three where the estimation have been somewhat spot on (August 2021 and May 2022 are similar). Based on this, I tried to poke around with a bit of basic math to see if there was a pattern to the estimate, e.g. that they used my consumption from the same month last year, did some sort of mean across multiple years or months, or if there was some trend analysis going on.\nBased on this, I could not explain the estimate directly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI’m just pulling these out of thin, yet very experience, air. I will synthesise these and present more examples elsewhere↩︎"

With the bright summer nights, we need less light and as the days get shorter towards the winter we need more. This assumes that a significant amount of our electricity is consumed by sources that somehow map to this rhythm. Lights are one source, but indoor entertainment (gaming, streaming, television, etc.) would also increase during the winter.\nIt is easy to observe the rhythm of the daylight changes in Figure 1, but the correlation with energy consumption is less obvious. Or rather, the erratic nature of the energy data obscures whatever might be there. It looks like the summer months are slightly below the 10 kwhs line, with the spring and fall months sitting on the line, and the winter months moving slightly above the 10 kwhs line. Turns out that when computing the correlation coefficient (r=0.243, see below), then there is hardly any correlation between daylight and electricity consumption data.\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrelation_coeffecient = {\n\n    const kwhs_array = days.map(d =>{\n        return d.kwhs\n    })\n\n    const daylight_array = days.map( d =>{\n        return d.daylight\n    })\n\n    const correlation = simplestats.sampleCorrelation(kwhs_array,daylight_array)\n    return correlation\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile dissapointed that the visualisation does not show a clear pattern, this also hightligt the benefits of visualising the data. While the correlation coefficient tell me that there is no correlation between daylight and electricity consumption, the visualisation (and making it) has a lot of additional benefits:\n\nI am learning useful information about the particular data from crafting the visualisation. Information that is useful for future experiments and visualisations.\nThe visualisation and data forces me to reflect on my hypothesis and look for alternative explanations\nThe visualisation provide hints and information useful for speculating about explanations on the relationship between consumption and annual patterns.\n\n\n\nSo, why does our annual electricity consumption not correlate with available daylight?\nThe hypothesis assumes that a significant amount of our electricity consumption goes to sources that decrease with an increase in available daylight and increase when it gets darker outside during the winther. That would mostly be electrical lights and indoor entertainment. First, I do not think that lights account for a significant amount of our consumption. This would go to refriguation, laundry and cooking. On top of that, most of our indoor lighting is LED based which consume only a few watts per unit per hour and our use of entertainment likely only changes marginally from summer to winther. I still play computer games and we still stream during the summer.\nThis pose an interesting question. We are often told that private consumers should change habits and implement various micro-initiatives as part of solutions toward the climate and energy crisis. While some initatives do work, the savings seem minimal. My guestimate is that we can properly optimize our consumption to save a couple of kilowatts per day at most. A lot of our consumption is not something we can change at the moment. We still need a freezer and refrigerator, and we need to cook meals. A lot of larger initiatives do not make economic sense. So, is it even possible to optimize household consumption in a meaningful way so it contributes to lowering the energy demand? I do not think so. Not without heavy economic incentives. I will try to explore everyday habits, theoretical savings and impact in a future post.\n\n\nShow the code\nsimplestats = require(\"simple-statistics@7\")\n// Loading our data file\ndays = FileAttachment(\"/public/data/el-consumption-days-all.csv\").csv({typed:true}).then(raw => {\n    var lat = 56.16, long=10.20\n    \n    //We want to simplify our objects and translate the values into appropriate formats.\n    //We keep the date and the value\n    raw = raw.filter(o => {\n        var str = o[\"Fra_dato\"].substring(6,10)\n        return o[\"Type\"] === \"Tidsserie\" && str != \"2017\"\n    })\n\n    raw = raw.map(o => {\n        // Create a data object\n        var dstr = o[\"Fra_dato\"].replace(\" 00:00:00\", \"\").split(\"-\")\n        var date = new Date(`${dstr[2]}-${dstr[1]}-${dstr[0]}`)\n      \n        //Create object for date\n            //Including data on the hours of the day\n        var sun = SunCalc.getTimes(new Date(date), lat,long)\n        var daylight = (sun.sunset - sun.sunrise) / 1000 / 60\n\n        var v = typeof o[\"Mængde\"] == \"string\" ? parseInt(o[\"Mængde\"]) : o[\"Mængde\"]\n\n        return {date: date, kwhs:v, daylight:daylight}\n    \n    })\n\n    //Sorting dates because the order is messy after conversion from object to array\n    raw.sort((a,b) => {\n        return a[\"date\"] > b[\"date\"]\n    })\n\n    return raw\n})"

    "section": "Instrumental interaction with databases",
    "text": "Instrumental interaction with databases\nOne of the most fundamental ways to interact with data is by using the Structured Query Language (SQL). Together with the relationel database, it was developed to help “the non-professional user into effective communication with a formatted database” (Chamberlin & Boyce, 1974, p. 250) and “to put end users into direct touch with the information stored in computers” (Codd, 2007, p. 109). SQL was considered an ideal way for non-programmers to access and query data. It was developed with an onset in English (Structured English Query Language – SEQUEL) and a declarative approach to data querying. While SQL turned out to be hugely succesful (Helland, 2016) and is one of the commonly used technologies today. However, the vision that the casual user without programming experience would use SQL to interact with databases on a frequent basis have not come true (yet).\n\n\nInteraction 1: SQL shell connected to a publication database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the interactive example above, you can use SQL as an instrument1 for interacting with the database. Try it – click on the terminal above and start typing. You can also click on the SQL code fields below and see the result.\nSELECT * FROM publications LIMIT 5;\nWhen we have to interact with an unfamiliar and undocumented database (like this one), we try to use the instrument to poke around to explore and discover how the data is organized and how to query for the information we need. This often involves multiple steps of trail-and-error to identify appropriate tables, their fields, relations and data:\nSELECT name FROM sqlite_master;\nSELECT * FROM authors LIMIT 5;\nSELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE name='authors';\nAnd you can do more complex stuff like querying multiple tables for specific results:\nSELECT publications.title, authors.first, authors.last, publications.year FROM publications INNER JOIN authorship ON publications.wid=authorship.wid INNER JOIN authors ON authorship.aid=authors.aid WHERE authors.last='Dewey'; \n\nTODO: Interactive quiz SQL -> Database quiz\n\nSQL as an instrument for interacting with data\nI know, I know – SQL has language in its name. How is it an instrument then2? It is a formal language that can be used to communicate between entities that can interpret it. However, it is not a natual language and the query formulation problem – the act of translating a question from a natural language into a formalized language – is a still a challenging problem under research (Hofstede et al., 1996; Papenmeier et al., 2020). I am not sure recasting SQL from a language to an instrument will resolve the query formulation problem, but thinking about it conceptually can be illuminating (which I will return to below)\nThere are many small signs that one could discuss SQL as an instrument. It is an invention, a technology that has undergone significant development since its inception in 1975. Knowing how to use3 SQL is also a highly valuable skill4 and it is something that needs to be learned in order to use it proficiently, and the way we learn it is through using it.\nThese losely collected observations are just hints. The main reason I think it makes sense to consider SQL as an instrument is that SQL is a means to an end; we use SQL on a database towards a desired outcome. If we venture a bit into activity theory,\nVygotsky has his famous -> continue from slides\nWe know it’s at tool because so much is about using: query formulation problem or query writing challenge.\n\n\nWhat does considering SQL as an instrument do for us?\n\nFirst, if SQL is an instrument for interacting with data, why should it be constrained to databases?\nSecond,\n\nI consider Instrumental Interaction a “foot in the door” to a significant class of topics and problems that are highly relevant to Human-Data Interaction, and can be solved to the benefit of…\n\nActivity theory – what if the query formulation problem is a too parter: A guestion of familiarity with the instrument and the object it is used upon: SQL as a means to explore querying (SQL),\nQuery formulation problem, not as something that can be solved by building better technologies (SQL, tools for exploration etc), but a fundamental dialectical interacition (dialogue with resistance/trial and error ->\n\nTrial-and-error as a phenomenon Trial-and-error as prototyping Trial-and-error as experiment Trial-and-error as seeing-moving-seeing (Schön -> consider also the Alan Dix paper) <- this is the pragmatism angle Trial-and-error as failure or inability (this is the anti-thesis)"

    "text": "In this note I am trying to identify a useful design or process model for Human-Data Interaction. I am not going to claim that HDI need a process model that stand a part from all the others, rather I would argue that we need an integrative one given that HDI is defined as “the human manipulation, analysis and sense-making of data.” Elmqvist (2011). My own interest can be formulated as the challenge of asking good questions to data, or rather, supporting citizens in asking good questions to public data. This involves examining the genesis of the question (information need) and how this interacts with data and the answer, and the process in between. A process model is useful tool in many ways:\nBecause different disciplines are concerned with different stages and have identified specific challenges and solutions, a process model is a tool for identifying and organize particular challenges, prior work, useful techniques and representations across multiple perspectives. For instance, knowledge discovery concerns itself with the early part of the data analytics process (Fayyad et al. 1996), (visual) analytics with the middle part (Sacha et al. 2014) and information visualization with the presentation (McKenna et al. 2014). None of these areas ignore the other steps, but take particular interest in challenges and solutions for a few primary aspects of the process.\nProcess models also describe and organize work and division of labor. They say something about what needs to be done when and by whom. This can be between collaborators, specialties, and consequently, the different tools and approaches applied in the process. Some pipeline models, like visualization or machine learning pipelines, describe technical systems, the flow of data and how this is processed once the system have been implemented (Moreland 2013). These can also be considered process models, because the individual components need to be developed and appropriated to the data and task at some point. A pipeline is also an object of design1.\nFinally, there are a class of process models that deal with the challenge of moving from an articulated need to a solutions through a series of activities that inform both the need and the solution (they all do). While Royces’ (1960) initial waterfall model describe a software engineering process, it also grapples with the inherent challenge of dealing with internal and external change in the process. When we start working on a problem, the work changes the articulation and nature of the problem as well as informing the solution (Dewey 1933, Popper 1966, Simon 1973, Rittel and Webber 1973, Schön 1983). While the models do not all take the iterative nature of the work into account, it is fundamental to the process 2 3. Design process models often put a strong emphasis on iteration, agile software engineering similarly, and a lot of the classical models also acknowledge the need for revisiting previous steps (e.g. Li et al. 2016). This is perhaps more about process thinking, sense-making, problem-solution formulation and dialectic reasoning, but this underscores any process.\nThe intent is to focus on relevance for human-data interaction, without venturing too far into specific topic areas or entire fields. I will include works that talk about ‘information’ (needs, seeking, behaviour) and knowledge discovery as well, as it plays a crucial role in motivating HDI and is a part of the outcome of the process – one want to be informed, know more about something than before and/or get a new perspective."

    "text": "A simple organizing model\nThe primary focus will be to describe a working model that allow us to identify and organize prior work and important problems for research and application. The model combine multiple models and I will do my best to pay attention to language and differences in the emphasis.\n\nInformation need\nThe process and model begin with an information need. What an information is or can be is an open question and pertains to the individual case. Hofstede et al. (1996) argue that it can be that of an organisation or individuals, which suggest that it is already articulated (which may be the case). It is also common that the information need comes from someone else, e.g. a client (find research on this) or someone else in the organization that needs to know something (find research on this). Regardless, an information need is often open and vague, and “a subjective experience that occurs only in the mind of the person in need and, consequently, is not directly accessible to an observer” (Wilson, 1997). Articulating the neeed is therefor inherently challenging and prone to “I don’t know what I’m looking for, but I’ll know when I find it” (Hofstede et al., 1996). This means that an information need can start with something puzzeling that needs to be informed before a concret question can be articulated: “A question well put is half answered” (Dewey, 1933). This is a dialectical process that involves taking initial steps into the process: “In fact, a number of the real world analysts we have interviewed strongly emphasized the fact that interation with the data leads to the formation of hypotheses.” (Brachman & Anand, 1994) And it is assumed that it is a social process and involves collaborative sensemaking (Paul & Reddy, 2010).\nThere are seveal things to consider here. First, the information need does not come out of the void. It comes from everyday experiences, and often when confronted with something that is puzzling and prompts further inquery. I speculate that when it comes to data-centric information needs, it can be triggered by being exposed to something that is already data-laden:\n\nWhen seeing ones electricity bill, one may wonder how the electricity price is determined or how much of the consumption is green energy?\nWhen experiencing delays in public transport, one may wonder how frequent such delays are or if there is a way to determine where the bus is currently?\nWhen discussing the climate crisis, one may question how much impact the individual have or what kind of habit changes make the biggest difference?\n\nIn the context of HDI, we assume that the user is somewhat motivated to find the information within a structure database or trusted source, and will not just be satisfied by searching the web. This is likely the case in a majority of instances, but we are only interested in supporting the transition from information need to interacting with data.\nSo, the first challenge and research theme in HDI interaction should be how people construct their information need – what is it they need to know? Why? and how does this develop and change througout the process? Is the final outcome an answer to the original information need or did it change?\nImportant readings here are both within philosophy on reasoning, problem formulation, dialectices etc. and traditional work within information sciences on information need and information seeking behaviour.\nI am not sure this is so relevant in understanding HDI, but for background stuff it might be.\n\n\nData discovery\nOnce some initial information need is articulated, the user will need to find some data that can inform this. In early work on knowledge discovery it was assumed that this involved consulting familiar data sources, e.g. a database within the organization or similar. For a subset of scenarios, this is also the case today, e.g. within business analysis, analytics, applied data science and modelling. However, with all the available data and the likelyhood that the information needer is not someone working close to a specific domain-specific database, this can easily involve trying to discover data that can inform the question.\nPeople within KDD talk about this step in the same way as they talk about wrangling.\nI think that this is more of an issue of identifying and establishing initial ideas about data platforms.\n\nconsensus data\nopen data\nworld et.c\n\n– search – assessment\n– Reddit study – Open data study\n\n\nData exploration\n\n\nData wrangling\n\n\nData analysis\n\n\nData products (outcomes)\n\nwhat\nrepresentation\napplication\nwhat are the key elements\nwhat are the vision\nwhat are the challenges\nwhat are the empirical studies\nwhat are the technical studies\nwhat are the key challenges\n\nCurrently, I am drawing on a basic step model that intends to describe the many places in common data analysis processes people may interact with data:"

    "text": "Looking for new challenges\nMy contract with Aarhus University ends this year. It has been an exciting and incredible ride, but every time I have visited collaborators and folks outside the university walls, in the software industry, digitization projects, the public sector, and other initiatives, I have been struck with all the amazing projects, talented people, and exciting challenges. Now I would like to try out the challenge – how far can my skills and experience bring the projects I engage in and contribute to?\nIf this sounds interesting to you or your organization, then reach out. I would love to connect and have a chat about future possibilities.\n\nSoftware engineering and IT-projects\nConstructing better software that generates value for the client and users is important to me. It drives my teaching and some of my early research projects. The challenge of moving from client and user needs to a solution that provides the right user experience is fascinating to me. It is all about translating needs and early ideas into requirements, features, and user stories. This involves both design research and aligning client and stakeholder expectations in the process, and tailoring the (agile) development process to the task and expectations.\nI have experience with multiple EU projects, research projects, and collaborations with the public sector. I have worked with various methods for identifying requirements in close collaboration with clients, through design research and user-centered methods, and software engineering. I am currently running a course on Experimental Systems Development where students are thought how to identify needs and solutions, write scenarios, explore prototypes, write user-stories and go through an agile process. I have supervised over 100 student projects within this course, multiple thesis projects, and other design projects.\nWhen I have the opportunity to participate in IT projects, I bring my strong communication skills, a rich set of methods, a strong analytical mindset, and experience in software development and multi-stakeholder projects.\n\n\nUser-centered initiatives around data and data-driven projects\nBecoming data-driven has become a requirement. This involves combining existing and new data, with both strong technical analysis and knowledge from multiple domain experts. Identifying new use cases and valuable analyses for client and/or organizational data is a challenging task that involves an understanding of the technical infrastructure and how organizations work with data and information.\nIn this role, I have experience with multiple data-oriented projects and research involving domain-experts in analytics and co-designing novel applications. I have an interest in the role of visualization, how people interact with and make sense of data, and strategic approaches in identifying the right technical- and organizational (governance) model for becoming more data-driven.\nIn addition to my skills in facilitating co-design processes and exploring novel use cases for (open) data, I also find it engaging to develop data visualizations as means to understanding data (model-fitness-use) and identify important insights."

That is to have dynamic pricing and add a peak-tariff to encurage people to remove or move their energy use from peak hour. That is an effective strategy, but it also something that affect individual economies differently (it has a socio-economic implication).\n\nMotivations?"
