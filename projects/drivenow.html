                <p>
                    The road systems and traffic infrastructure is highly
                    instrumented with devices to capture data on flow,
                    incidents, congestion etc. These data are used by the
                    planning departments and vendors to develop their strategy
                    and measure and respond to changes in traffic patterns. In
                    this project, we wanted to investigate a use-case for some
                    of this data as open data:
                    <em
                        >How could we develop an application that could support
                        citizens in their daily lives based on open data?</em
                    >
                    or more specifically
                    <em
                        >how could citizens interact more or less directly with
                        urban data?</em
                    >
                </p>

                <p>
                    The answer was an application where users could query live
                    traffic data and receive driving recommendations based on
                    congestion and flow data. The screenshots above illustrate
                    the flow of the application: First, the user selects a
                    predefined destination, e.g. work, and then queries the
                    service by pressing the "Should I Drive Now?" button. Then
                    the service would calculate the commute time between the
                    current location and chosen destination based on real-time
                    traffic data. Then it compares the current commute time with
                    a precalculated ideal (normal traffic flow). If the delta
                    was acceptable, the recommendation would be <em>"yes"</em>.
                    If the route is congested, the application would recommend
                    <em>"maybe"</em>, with some detailed information on specific
                    hotspots and a recommendation on
                    <em>"perhaps wait 15 minutes to depart"</em>. If there is a
                    gridlock, the application would recommend similar to
                    <em>"maybe"</em>, but add a recommendation to change commute
                    patterns for subsequent days, e.g.
                    <em
                        >"if you can schedule your drive early next time, then
                        you can avoid congestion"</em
                    >.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an additional feature (and to provide an explanation),
                    users could also see a map with hotspots on the current
                    traffic situation.
                </p>

                <h2>Smart city and open data context</h2>

                <p>
                    This project also served as a deliverable and demonstrator
                    in a local smart city initiative
                    <a href="https://smart.aarhus.dk/">Smart Aarhus</a>. I was a
                    member of the secretariat and working group on open data.
                </p>

                <p>In this context, the application should demonstrate:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A locally developed "Smart City" application</li>
                    <li>A use-case for open data</li>
                    <li>
                        An internal instrument to motivate and understand the
                        process of working with open data
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    As part of the development of the application, I developed
                    some of the early integrations between the Blip Systems
                    real-time tracking software and the CKAN open data platform.
                    The data is still maintained and available on the, now
                    Danish,

                <h2>Drive now application design</h2>

                <p>
                    The development of the project happened in close
                    collaboration with people from the municipal traffic
                    department and Smart Aarhus. The concept was developed
                    during an inspiration card workshop and further refined
                    through a series of design meetings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was design lead and developer on the project, with
                    frequent support and input from Smart Aarhus and the
                    participants from the municipal traffic department.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jacob Rosenberg developed the graphics for the interface and
                    Martin Brynskov provided input on tricky design decisions
                    and project management.
                </p>

                <h2>Application implementation</h2>

                <p>
                    This is the largest system I have developed independently,
                    with quite a lot of components and steps. The system
                    consisted of:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>An iOS smartphone application (Objective-C)</li>
                    <li>
                        A backend service providing recommendations (Heroku,
                        Node.js/CoffeeScript)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A GIS database for route segments and precalculated
                        travel times (PostgreSQL PostGIS)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integration with the CKAN open data platform for live
                        traffic data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integration with a GIS distance API for address
                        resolution
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    For this project, I had to learn almost all the technologies
                    from the get-go, including Objective-C, working with GIS
                    data, PostgreSQL PostGIS module, Heroku and to some extent
                    CoffeeScript. Deploying the application to Heroku and
                    Apple's App Store was also an experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I got several requests on making an Android version of the
                    application, but at that point the project did not have any
                    additional funding. I started developing it, but it was just
                    not feasible at the time.
                </p>

                <h2>Outcomes and publication</h2>

                <p>
                    The application proved useful to commuting citizens; on its
                    release in 2014, it got almost 5000 downloads and unique
                    users in the first six months. The underlying real-time
                    traffic data was made available through the local data
                    platform as part of the project and is
