                        Hi, I'm Henrik. This site is a mix between keeping track
                        of what I do and then writing about the stuff that pops
                        into my head.

                    <p>
                        I work as a solution architect at
                        <a href="knowit.dk">knowit.dk</a>. My responsibilities
                        seem to be anything from consulting on enterprise-,
                        solution- and application architecture, to working with
                        technical project management, tech leadership and
                        mentoring, and helping teams and clients get on board
                        with AI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Previously, I was an assistant professor in Computer
                        Science, at Aarhus University. My main research focus
                        was in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, with a
                        special interest in collaborative computing around data
                        and interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have an MSc in Information Technology on Interaction
                        Design, Open Data, and Smart City technologies. I hold a
                        Ph.D. in Computer Science from Aarhus University in
                        Human-Computer Interaction (Interaction Design, User
                        Experience, User-centered design, and design research).
                        My thesis focuses on the theoretical and empirical
                        foundations for location-based services and community
                        software.
