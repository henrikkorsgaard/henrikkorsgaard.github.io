                        that took place in Aarhus, Denmark, on the 2nd of
                        November 2022. Our discussion was broadly animated by a
                        couple of concerns. Firstly, the long-running
                        conversation in HCI about its 'status' (as a field, as a
                        discipline, as a respectable pursuit within the academic
                        superstructure) and its constitution (as an
                        un-/non-discipline and as concerns its
                        interdisciplinarity). And secondly, the overall feeling
                        of what it's like being 'kicked around' by technology,
                        which we sensed much of HCI (and other fields) have
                        experienced for a long time (including ourselves). The
                        conversation is depicted here as a series of turns
                        between Henrik and Stuart but this is mainly for the
                        purposes of presentation. In reality, Henrik initiated
                        some notes, and Stuart then provided further commentary
                        on the notes.</em

                    <strong>Henrik:</strong> What do we mean by theory and why
                    do we need it? There are two challenges here. First,
                    pedagogy (the second being collective memory within our
                    field, I will return to that). What do you teach from HCI
                    research within a CS program? While there are many available
                    textbooks, they are often design and technology centric and
                    do not constrain a strain or common core of HCI theories. I
                    jokingly say that there are more pictures of technology in
                    our textbooks than references to evidence-based research and
                    theory. Other fields have classics that present how the
                    discipline or field developed and used to think about
                    particular matters. They are still taught either as an
                    introduction to more complex ideas or as part of becoming a
                    member of a particular discipline. A typical example is that
                    we are still teaching Newtonian ideas as partly introductory
                    (because they are accurate enough for most people) and as
                    understanding the history of physics, before progressing to
                    more complex stuff. We also discussed parallels to
                    psychology that also engage with old ideas in classics as a
                    background to understanding traditions and more recent
                    ideas. Thomas Kuhn talks a lot about textbooks as a way to
                    understand current paradigm of a particular field, as a
                    source of authority, and when there is a paradigm shift,
                    they retain some of the history of the field and a sense of
                    discipline:

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "Textbooks thus begin by truncating the scientist's
                        sense of his discipline's history and then proceed to
                        supply a substitute for what they have eliminated.
                        Characteristically, textbooks of science contain just a
                        bit of history, either in an introductory chapter or,
                        more often, in scattered references to the great heroes
                        of an earlier age. From such references both students
                        and professionals come to feel like participants in a
                        long-standing historical tradition."

                <p>
                    I guess, what I am missing here is not only a
                    technology-centric history and/or tradition (remember,
                    Grudin's "The Computer Reaches Out" is about interfaces and
                    not the theories and concepts used to make sense of these
                    changes).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Stuart:</strong> We started this discussion
                    initially because of your immediate practical concerns about
                    teaching. I think I faced similar fundamental problems (and
                    reflections on ways to move forwards with these problems)
                    when teaching an introductory HCI module some time ago.
                    Teaching HCI leads you to question how the mass of
                    complexity of a whole research field's work gets packaged up
                    in a 'textbook' way for students. This then makes you wonder
                    "what is at the core of HCI and how stable, substantial, and
                    consistent is it?". You think "why aren't there these books
                    that everyone knows in common which I can point to as
                    eternal features of a shared intellectual landscape?". The
                    first question that springs to mind is whether the
                    'textbook' view of research is similar to or representative
                    of the lived experience of it as part of a community of
                    researchers? Are we fooling ourselves into dreaming of a
                    thing that never was? It is true that there are probably
                    fewer 'classic texts' which can provide the level of ongoing
                    intellectual nourishment that other fields benefit from. But
                    maybe this is a function of the technology driving things
                    rather than ideas driving things?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second thing that this conversation here assumes (or at
                    least doesn't draw attention to) a certain intellectual
                    arrangement of universities, institutions etc. that have a
                    history of specific ways of interrogating and arranging
                    things like 'disciplines'. HCI and its pedagogy, its
                    forebears, the institutional and cultural situation it finds
                    itself in is a product of that environment and the cultures
                    it has emerged from (many of which are rightly being
                    challenged today). The third thing to mention is that SIGCHI
                    has had an Education Task Force for some time, and EduCHI is
                    now a thing. There's been prior work here e.g., started by
                    Jenny Preece, Anne Bowser and Elizabeth Churchill some time
                    ago. I'm not sure how this conversation connects with that
                    (yet). Finally I want to say that the go-to analogy is
                    physics and we reach for it immediately here. I don't think
                    you are implying that there is somehow some
                    commensurability, but rather the general perceived sense of
                    'stability' is an important component of the trouble sensed
                    with HCI. I characterise this as 'trouble' but we should
                    remember that trouble is not necessarily there to be
                    'solved'.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You also mention discipline. But there are many basic things
                    which HCI researchers do not agree upon or align on. To me
                    the only points of agreement (and maybe even this is wrong)
                    is that HCI is 'about' technology (usually interactive in
                    some way) and design. The rest is up for discussion. Even
                    notions about 'interactivity' are themselves in question.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Henrik:</strong> We touched upon recent discussions
                    circulating around the lack of common motor themes in HCI
                    and tensions and challenges from being an interdisciplinary
                    field. The keyword analysis of Liu et al. - and relatedly,
                    Kostakos - and the reported the lack of "motor themes" may
                    be methodologically misdirected, but they point to something
                    that is missing in HCI research. What the missing component
                    is, is open. Even the question whether HCI needs some common
                    core or motor themes is debatable. I guess what I feel is
                    missing (and it is a feeling and experience, not something I
                    can firmly back up) is something enduring whether we call it
                    classics, motor themes (based on something else than
                    keywords), theory, concepts, canonical examples for
                    textbooks (again, Kuhn would say that a paradigm in
                    textbooks do not separate the theory from the canonical
                    examples from the canonical exercises). Here, I come back to
                    the question of theory. To me, theory plays an important
                    role as a field or disciplines collective memory. It saves
                    the phenomenon between the concrete and the abstract. It
                    helps us avoid the 'nomadic' life Kostakos presents. And it
                    can help us repeat work, perpetually starting from first
                    principles etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Stuart:</strong> I dislike the scientism of Kostakos
                    and Liu et al. and the method; there are fairly obvious
                    possible 'cores' (subcommunities, shared interests, common
                    orientations, etc.) one could easily point to, simply by
                    being a researcher involved in HCI for enough time.
                    Pretending that we cannot do that unless it is part of a
                    'scientific analysis' is to my mind extremely limiting. I
                    also think that the notion of 'accumulation' - unstated but
                    nevertheless runs through our discussion - needs to be
                    reflected upon as a 'science norm' which may be based on a
                    specific 'picture' of research activity. And being
                    reflective scholars we should be cognisant of the manner of
                    our investigations too (the big E word, i.e.,
                    'epistemology'). Thus, treating HCI unreflectively as
                    compared with a picture of 'normal science' isn't really a
                    useful way to think about what HCI could possibly be / be
                    doing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You suggest that theory may be described as collective
                    memory. It may be that HCI does actually 'do' what people
                    would comfortably call 'theory', yet does not label it as
                    such. Thus by foregrounding particular things (application,
                    domain, technology, etc.) we may be missing what are
                    actually aspects that do act as a 'core' for some people
                    (i.e., reframing things dissolves the perceived 'problem').
                    This goes back to HCI's attitudes towards technology - and
                    the tail wagging the dog. HCI's beholdenness to tech may
                    disguise parts of its collective programme that are actually
                    substantially contributing to 'theory', thus also feeding
                    into the concerns about 'theory' and 'cores'.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Henrik:</strong> We often have to repeat and account
                    for aspects of methodology, epistemology, traditions and
                    theoretical orientations that we feel should be somewhat
                    established now, 50 some years into HCI research. There is a
                    sense that, given the strong commitment to design
                    (implications) and informing HCI practitioners, years of
                    insights remain local to particular topics and individual
                    studies. This may also be unevenly distributed, in the sense
                    that user studies and laboratory experiments feel more
                    established than for instance ethnomethodological work and
                    theoretical work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Stuart:</strong> As Taylor has argued, there is a
                    particular "default mode" of HCI which he calls
                    "Engelbartian interaction". This means some things are left
                    unexplicated because that is just 'normal HCI'. Other
                    approaches have to be constantly justified because they
                    breach various unstated norms and taken-for-grantedness. We
                    could connect this back to our discussion about the history
                    of HCI, geographic distribution, etc., and how that
                    particular path or set of paths taken by different
                    communities has led us to this point.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Henrik:</strong> So, back to that which may be
                    missing. We cannot pinpoint directly what is missing, but
                    some enduring constructs, synthesis work and a more grounded
                    understanding of the full range of HCI methodology seem to
                    be what the conversation lingers around. I suggest that
                    theory should step into this space as something enduring
                    (that is the role theory has played in other fields). It is
                    striking that contemporary contributions still lament that
                    the field cannot account for basic phenomena or the state of
                    these constructs. Again, the missing bit or hole in HCI
                    research creates trouble for the field. Internally, because
                    it is hard to synthesise work into teachable constructs,
                    compare decades of effects proven in the lab, themes from
                    the field and ideas. When other areas look to HCI research
                    for answers, models and principles, it is unclear to us
                    where they should look and what they will find.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Stuart:</strong> You raise a point about
                    appearances, not only practical problems introduced by the
                    needs of pedagogy (and the specific structures /
                    arrangements / assumptions within that sits, situated within
                    - in our limited experience - (specific) European contexts)
                    - but also issues of respectability, how HCI 'looks' to
                    others outside of HCI. It should be the case that we can
                    openly talk about how these typically unvoiced concerns may
                    play a role in the discussion here, and the drives towards
                    producing what you call "the enduring".
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Henrik:</strong> Yes, and not only respectability.
                    Depending on how one counts, HCI is a field with 50+ history
                    and work (I typically count from Licklider's 1960 paper,
                    because I like the paper. Others might count from the first
                    CHI conference). So when other areas encounter challenges,
                    they may look to us for answers - theories, constructs,
                    guidance. There are many contemporary challenges where we
                    face problems that HCI and CSCW should have some textbook
                    answers to. The massive and hastily migration to remote work
                    under COVID19 for instance. Where are the synthesis
                    insights, models, recommendations, theories for designers
                    and engineers at Zoom, Gathertown, Discord, Slack, Miro to
                    scrutinise to develop better support for everything remote?
                    People working on remote work prior to COVID19 often had
                    problems convincing reviewers of the relevance.

                    Or with the increased trend of having prompt-based command
                    line interactions with ML models (so-called prompt-based
                    learning), where is the synthesis (and continued) work on
                    command line interaction? Similarly, work on Human-AI
                    collaboration in Nature seems to have ignored both HCI and
                    CSCW. Maybe they had a quick look and concluded they were
                    better off starting from scratch. Or when Infovis started to
                    look at interaction as important, it seems like they had to
                    do a first-principle approach instead of learning from HCI.
                    And what about newcomers to HCI? If you cannot easily get
                    'some' overview over 'some' parts of HCI without having to
                    read Grudin, Bødker, Rogers, Shneiderman and multiple others
                    in parallel, how do you contribute? Or rather, when Rogers
                    says "anything goes in HCI research", then it's hardly
                    surprising that people skip the classics to go for the quick
                    contribution.

                    <strong>Stuart:</strong> On this point, there are papers
                    which do try to do 'meta theory' or construct 'meta
                    taxonomies' to arrange HCI work in response to these
                    concerns about "enduring constructs". But the central
                    problem facing this task is that of incommensurability. In
                    other words, I think HCI is just the community interface
                    where we share ideas, but owing to HCI's non-disciplinary
                    nature, the ways we come to those ideas cannot come under
                    some shared schema no matter how 'meta'. That said, if we
                    re-frame efforts to construct a 'meta theory' of HCI into
                    something seemingly less grand but far more practical like
                    'a tourism guidebook' then we may benefit from the things
                    which that analogy entails. Guidebooks try to be accurate
                    but they do not present a grand theory of a city or other
                    tourist destination. Guidebooks get out of date, but they
                    still retain value, and even may provide historical
                    significance some time later. They contain impressions and
                    opinions on ways to engage with the location of interest,
                    but they are not the only way to get value. They try to boil
                    down complexity into something manageable. That said, the
                    notion of the 'HCI guidebook' is still a bit different to
                    your idea of 'classics'.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Henrik:</strong> I like the idea of a HCI guidebook
                    for now. I do believe that there is a space for more theory
                    and more pluralistic theory. And your point on
                    incommensurability is key here. Right now I think that the
                    HCI theory space suffers more from meaning variance and lack
                    of well-described positions and constructs. Once some of
                    this synthesis and theorising work develop more clearly,
                    then, we can explore common philosophy of science issues as
                    they face us. Incommensurabilities and other issues feel
                    like a downstream topic and an entirely different
                    conversation.

                    <strong>Henrik:</strong> Kostakos identifies the strong
                    focus on implications for design as problematic. We share
                    that focusing on 'HCI practitioners' as a primary audience
                    for direct research results is perhaps a bit of a
                    misunderstanding in the field. Typically, one would expect
                    that practitioners of a field get their knowledge and ideas
                    from textbooks and lectures, and not through shifting
                    through CHI proceedings for 'strong concepts' and
                    'implications for design'. If we rely (only) on synthesising
                    our knowledge as implications for design, these insights
                    will suffer in multiple ways: They will likely remain local
                    to particular research publications. We have no tradition of
                    or systematic ways of comparing insights (like other fields
                    compare results, models and theories). They are likely (seen
                    as) valid only to particular technologies or classes of
                    technologies. And unless we are mistaken and the main
                    readership of CHI proceedings is busy HCI folks in industry,
                    then the most recognised epistemological construct in HCI
                    research does not have an audience.

                <p>
                    This brings us to a final summary of the sense of something
                    missing and/or why something is missing. We largely feel
                    that HCI research is getting kicked around by technology.
                    This is perhaps Kostakos's point as well, but his analogy
                    with nomads feel inadequate to our experiences. For the
                    inventive part of HCI research, new technologies may bring
                    excitement and opportunities for riding a new wave of
                    novelty, relevance, funding and contributions. For us, the
                    experience is different. One does not have to read that much
                    outside HCI before the idea that 'new' technologies are
                    rarely new (history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes;
                    history of infrastructure and bureaucracy and computing and
                    all that jazz). Except for a few radical inventions,
                    technology is only new when deliberately positioned in an
                    "we live in unprecedented times" / epochalism narrative.
                    Hence, the fascination with the 'new' often becomes an
                    instance of having to relate to the 'new' in our own
                    publications, funding proposals, institutions etc., while we
                    at the same time must resist the temptation to critiquing
                    the new, which distracts us from our own research.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The way we put technology front and centre in publication
                    titles is another way we are being kicked around by
                    technology. (And this is perhaps where Kostakos's keyword
                    analysis is hitting the actual problem.) Putting specific
                    technologies (social media), specific instances of
                    technologies (Facebook) or the catchy names of our own
                    inventions in paper titles seem counterproductive to
                    developing enduring constructs and classics that can speak
                    to more than the latest technologies. We are hiding a lot of
                    the contributions to our collective knowledge (whatever that
                    is) in the deep end of our publications. How can you pick up
                    an idea, theory, concept, implication etc. and engage
                    productively with it, if finding things that speak to each
                    other is almost impossible?
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Stuart:</strong> To that I would add that while
                    there are strong pockets of work within HCI that are
                    definitely 'kicking back' at technology, almost everything
                    seems to be working against us doing this. There is only a
                    relatively small amount of work questioning the largely
                    corporate-driven and individualist basis of most
                    technologies that get play in HCI. I can point the finger
                    directly at myself included in this regard - recently we
                    have had a number of relatively successful studies of voice
                    interfaces - but you could quite reasonably critique this
                    style of work as essentially glorified (albeit sceptical)
                    product research. Much HCI is like this, unquestioning of
                    the technical fundamentals which underpin and form core
                    assumptions, even when this work is designated 'critical'.
                    Maybe I shouldn't be so hard on this work - it is not
                    unreasonable to explore the objects, infrastructures,
                    systems in the world as you find them. Social computing has
                    done a roaring trade in that. But, alternatives, different
                    arrangements of and conceptions of technology seem to be
                    rumbling there under the surface all the time. By that I
                    mean state-, civic-, or community-oriented technologies -
                    although considered in HCI's body of work - nevertheless
                    have this extant substrate to work with (devices,
                    infrastructures), the assumptions of which - largely
                    privatised, and individualised - bring their own
                    difficulties when retooling for these alternate purposes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Henrik:</strong> I would like to make a final
                    (post-conversation) note on some of these issues. It doesn't
                    have to be this way. There are multiple open questions and
                    ambitions to work toward. I do not think that theory should
                    replace anything, but I would also like to be able to work
                    just on HCI theory as a more creative and indigenous genre
                    of HCI contributions. CHI puts up a high bar for theory
                    contributions. A high bar that does not leave room for
                    creativity and experimentation with indigenous theory.
                    Similarly, it is not given that HCI should maintain its
                    fascination and uncritical stance toward industry or the
                    very idea that HCI practitioners and companies are the sole
                    or primary audience for HCI research. Finally, briefly
                    returning to the question of discipline, interdiscipline or
                    speciality. This is not given either. I think it is
                    important to remember that when we give HCI attention in our
                    educational programs and courses, we are also bringing up a
                    new generation of researchers who may feel that this is more
                    a pluralistic (inter)discipline than a meeting between
                    multiple disciplines.
