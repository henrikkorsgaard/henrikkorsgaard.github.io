                <p>
                    We can learn a lot, it turns out. In this research project,
                    I developed a series of visualizations of document revisions
                    to support qualitative interviews and analysis related to
                    collaborative writing, approaches, division of labour and
                    contributions to a shared text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We interviewed multiple groups of people writing together
                    and got access to their shared document. From there, we
                    downloaded the revisions and analyzed them using tools
                    (scripts) developed for the task.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main focus of the visualizations was to identify
                    <em>where</em> in the document authors worked and
                    <em>when</em> in relation to the
                    <em>work of their co-authors</em>. We hypothesized that
                    authors divided the writing into tasks centered around
                    particular sections in the document, e.g. being responsible
                    for a specific section. What we call "territories" in the
                    research publication.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To inform this hypothesis and identify territories and
                    collaborative writing patterns (hand-over, edits etc.), we
                    analyzed Google Document text revisions. These consist of
                    one insert or remove operation with n characters. Google
                    Document text operations are <em>chronological</em>, so the
                    main challenge is to analyze the revisions in terms of where
                    they are in the document.
                </p>

                <h2>Insights</h2>

                <p>
                    The visualizations helped us identify a few interesting
                    patterns on how co-authors write together over time. These
                    correlate with the themes from the qualitative interviews.
                    Each line in the visualizations corresponds to a paragraph
                    in the text and the spatial/indexical order of the edits.
                    For some paragraphs, we only see a few blocks, e.g. one for
                    a copy-paste, whereas for others we see significantly more
                    edits (both characters currently in the paragraph and
                    deleted characters).
                </p>

                        visualization corresponds to a paragraph in the shared
                        document.

                <p>
                    First, we observed the territories hypothesized in the
                    research. The figure below shows how several authors (blue,
                    yellow and green) work in different parts of a larger
                    document, with few edits in the blocks of the co-authors.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img
                        src="../media/images/projects/collaborative-writing/collaborative-writing-vis-1.png"
                        alt="Visual example of author territories"
                    />
                    <figcaption>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    Second, we observed that collaborative writing often means
                    people divide the sections and do the bulk of the writing in
                    their part of the document. When writing in other people's
                    paragraphs, the visualization shows that this is typically
                    smaller edits (typos, wording etc.) and/or transitions
                    between different paragraphs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Third, the visualizations helped us to identify the temporal
                    patterns of collaborative writing. The figure below shows
                    how two collaborators – author A and author B – write
                    together. A started writing, then added a few bits here and
                    there, and then B takes over and adds text in the middle and
                    end of the paragraph (and then later C – green joins and
                    adds text in the beginning).
                </p>

                        alt="Temporal analysis of turn-taking"

                <p>
                    The work and visualizations are primarily research
                    instruments to answer a research question. The work is
                    available in our paper on
                    <a

                <p>
                    My main contribution to the work was developing the analysis
                    and visualizations of the Google Document revisions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have considered further developing this work toward a
                    tool, but the incentives are a bit absent at the moment.
