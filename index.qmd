I want to help you build better software! 

After a decade as a researcher in Computer Science at Aarhus University, I'm looking for new oppertunities to apply and expand my skills.

In the span of the last 10 years as a HCI researcer, I have built countless of applications, demos, distributed systems, data analysis and more. I have supervised over 100 projects within product design, user experience, systems design and development. I've lectured about UX research and design, agile methodologies, C4 models, UML, software patterns and websockets, data-driven projects, evaluation, project management and much more. I've spendt countless hours at the whiteboard grokking a particular problem or helping students identify the _right_ architecture or _why_ their current system breaks. 

I'm excited about building software and that's what I want to do more of. I can step into a role as a senior UX or as a software developer or solution architect. It could also be something entirely new!

Ping me for a chat over coffee!

Currently, I'm an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Aarhus University, with human-data interaction as my research focus. I try to understand how to better integrate data into application design, interactive systems, analytics, visualization, and interaction design from an end-user perspective. I research how people use data and explore new tools to support analytics, visualization, and data-driven approaches. I teach experimental system development, design research, user-driven agile software development, co-design, and prototyping. 

I have an MSc in Information Technology on Interaction Design, Open Data, and Smart City technologies. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Aarhus University in Human-Computer Interaction (Interaction Design, User Experience, User-centered design, and design research). My thesis focuses on the theoretical and empirical foundations for location-based services and community software.
