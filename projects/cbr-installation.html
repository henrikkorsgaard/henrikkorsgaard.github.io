                    In 2012, I helped develop a media facade installation on the
                    iconic city hall tower in Aarhus. The installation was part
                    of the Media Architecture Biennale 2012 hosted in Aarhus.
                    The installation on the city hall tower consisted of 5500
                    LEDs. We used these to show an animated data visualization
                    of incoming and outgoing communication via the municipal
                    <a
                        href="https://www.aarhus.dk/demokrati/abenhed/postlister/"
                        >"Postliste" data</a
                    >. Whenever a citizen makes an inquiry to the municipality,
                    they have to reply in a timely manner. With the
                    visualization of the response rate for individual requests,
                    the media facade shows how some citizen requests are handled
                    timely (blue dots), whereas others are delayed beyond the
                    set reply rate (red dots).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project was part of a broader effort in my work at Smart
                    Aarhus on open data and my research and work within Urban
                    Interaction design. The installation was accompanied by a
                    platform where citizens of Aarhus could report issues or
                    what we called "Urban Bugs".
                </p>

                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>
                    The concept was developed through a participatory design
                    workshop involving students, researchers, stakeholders from
                    the city, designers and participants from Smart Aarhus.
                </p>

                    />
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The key goal was to develop a project that could connect our
                    efforts in working with and making more civic data publicly
                    available, and create visibility around Smart Aarhus and the
                    Media Architecture Biennale.
                </p>

                <h2>Data visualization</h2>

                <p>
                    The media facade visualizes data from the public mailing
                    list within the city. It cycles through a year of
                    communication between citizens and municipal departments.
                    The video below is a live capture from the installation.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <video controls width="100%">
                        <source
                            src="../media/images/projects/cbr/cbr-short.mp4"
                            type="video/mp4"
                        />
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The key idea is that blue dots represents incoming requests
                    from citizens and red dots represents outgoing replies from
                    the municipality. The larger the dot, the longer the
                    timespan in the reply.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The data visualization is more artistic than communicative,
                    mainly because of the challenge involved in communicating
                    the complexities of the data on a low resolution LED-dot
                    display.
                </p>

                <h2>Project and publications</h2>

                <p>
                    My main role in the project was to develop the design
                    concept and help the different stakeholders align input and
                    expectations. The project developed quite rapidly over a
                    couple of months with a workshop, design meetings,
                    collaborations within the city on data sources etc. One of
                    our students at the time, Kristian, developed the animation
                    (in Flash no less!) and volunteers helped install the LED
                    rails on the tower. I contributed with data analysis, 3D
                    mock-ups, back-end development (primarily with the
                    <a href="./cbr-platform.html">sister-project</a>). The
                    project turned out to be one of the two projects that ended
                    up forming my Master thesis.
