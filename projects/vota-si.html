                    create an installation that replays Twitter data from the
                    Catalan independence referendum vote in October 2017.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Josecarlos created the lovely video above on the project. I
                    really like the project and the kind of spur-of-the-moment
                    connection we made. It is Josecarlos's idea, I'm just happy
                    that I got a chance to collaborate with him.

                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>
                    In 2017, I was in Barcelona to conduct interviews with
                    people involved in a civic data collection and visualization
                    project. This was during the Catalan independence referendum
                    vote in October 2017. At that point the city was full of
                    signs and posters encouraging either "Vota Si" or "Vota No".
                    The first night I was startled by loud metallic banging at
                    22:00 in the city. I soon learned that the people of
                    Barcelona bang their pots and pans outside in support for
                    the referendum.
                </p>

                    />
                </figure>

                <p>
                    A few days later I ended up interviewing a designer and
                    media artist named Josecarlos Florez on his participation in
                    the data project. He participated in the project because he
                    was fascinated by data and how it can be used to influence
                    local political issues. After the interview he started
                    talking about an idea he had for an upcoming installation
                    involving people's conversation on the referendum on social
                    media. He asked if I knew how to mine Twitter data. I do and
                    I liked the idea and started working on it as soon as I came
                    back to my hotel.
                </p>

                <h2>Replaying Twitter Data</h2>

                <p>
                    Josecarlos' idea was simple. He wanted to capture tweets
                    based on hashtags associated with the vote and in particular
                    the two sides. Then he wanted to record the timestamps of
                    the tweets and store the timing. This would then be used to
                    play back the tweets on pots and pans, while a display would
                    show the tweets.

                <p>
                    I set up a simple data mining script in preparation for
                    October 1st and captured the data. I used Node.js to mine
                    the data using the Twitter API and the keywords above. I
                    stored each tweet in a MongoDB and checked for duplicates,
                    e.g. retweets without any comments etc. In order to allow
                    Josecarlos to replay the data, I created a small websocket
                    server, also using Node.js, and created an entry-point on my
                    website. This allowed him to connect his Arduino setup and
                    replay the data in his installation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Josecarlos made the brilliant setup in the video above to
                    replay the data on pots using an Arduino and home-made
                    drum-like actuators. The tweets are replayed on the laptop
                    as well.
