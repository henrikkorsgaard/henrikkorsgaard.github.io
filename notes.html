                <h2>From handwriting to fonts</h2>
                <p>I just stumbles upon Chris Smith's <a href="">Making a font of my handwriting.</a> That is just lovely. I might do that someday. My "logo" for this site (and 10-15 personal projects since circa 2007) has been my handwritten signature. Scanned, cleaned and vectorized. I mostly use it as a .png tho.</p>

                <h2>Streaming is a scam</h2>
                <i>I just subscribed to Apple TV, because I wanted to watch the new F1 movie. Turns out I can rent it for $19.99. That was not obvious from when I clicked and activated signup.</i>
                <p>In the last decade, steaming has changed from something <i>smart</i> and <i>convenient</i> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern#Roach_motel">roach hotel.</a></p>

                <i>And to make matters worse, when I started watching something else on Apple TV, I experience pauses and spinners. I could'nt even watch something else with a decent experience.</i>

                <p>And this sums up my experience with streaming services: I activate a subscription to watch something, and then there are a all these minor inconviniences: Content recommendations are forced in my face, sometimes with auto-play; search is sub-par; performance is erratic; and somehow, whenever there is something I want to watch, it is marked as 'disappearing soon' or only available on <i>different service</i>. And I need to make sure I unsubscribe again to avoid building up a monthly bill across multiple services.</p>

                <p>Oh, and services are now adding ads to their plans. Second oh, I once had to cancel a credit card to get out ot Amazon Prime.</p>

                <p><b>Congratulations! Capitalism just found a way to reinvent cable TV with a higher price point.</b></p>

                <p><i>No wonder some are moving back to buying media in thrift stores or pirating online.</i></p>

                <p>Ok - I'm not advocating piracy. But I am considering going back to DVDs for my favorites. Regarding piracy, and the <i>If buying isn’t owning, piracy isn’t stealing,</i><a href="https://jorisvandijk.com/posts/piracy/">Joris van Dijk has a (boring) point.</a></p>

                <h2>Let's see how far HTML and CSS will take us</h2>
                <p>After five years, a career change and a lot of hands-on experience with frontend frameworks in my daily work in software, it is time to update my personal site. The old site ran on <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> and I either needed to update that template and commit myself to writing more using the tools in quarto.  <i>Or</i> roll my own site. In Quarto I was writing in Markdown and let Quarto render the site to HTML before publishing on Github pages. For a brief moment, I was tempted to jump at <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/publish/setup">Obsidian Publish</a>, but I do not need another subscription in my life.</p>
                        
                <p>So instead of writing markdown and converting it to HTML, how different is it to just write HTML? After all, one of the key ideas in Ted Nelson's <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/nmeyrowi/LiteraryMachinesChapter2.pdf">Literary Machines</a> and later in Tim Berners-Lee's <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/369245/files/dd-89-001">Information Management: A Proposal</a> is that we should <i>write</i> HyperText and <i>link</i> it together.</p>

                <p>So in this iteration of my site, I want to see how far plain old HTML5 and CSS can get me. I know I will add Javascript etc. because <i>interactivity</i> is really nice. In reality, I also want to avoid setting up a complex system that I need to maintain and will get in the way of writing stuff. So here is the stack in all it's glory:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML5</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>GIT</li>
                    <li>Github</li>
                </ul>

                <i>Let's see how far that will get me as a daily driver.</i>
