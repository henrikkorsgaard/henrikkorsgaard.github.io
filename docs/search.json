    "text": "What happens when you do a project with me?\nBelow are some details on the different genres of projects I typically supervise, the process and some details on my approach to supervision.\n\nChosing an approach\nWhen doing a project, it is important to consider which approach to take. This will determine the kind of project, required steps and outcomes, how the work is evaluated and assessed, and the activities that will take priority in the project. I supervise three different types of projects or combinations thereof. If you have taken the course I teach on Experimental Systems Developement, the approches should be familiar:\n\nExperimental prototyping: Develop and evaluate tools and techniques for X\nDesign project: Involve users (U) in exploring and designing a prototype on X for U\nEmpirical research: Study X within a specific context and activity\n\nFor experimental prototyping, you will spend time reading related work, developing various experimental prototypes (Floyd 1984) and evaluate these in a user study (MacKenzie 2012). This involves designing the study and analysing the qualitative and quantitative results.\nFor design projects, you will have to recruit a group of users and go through a full design project with workshops and iterations toward a final prototype (Bødker et al. 2022). This can be evaluated through a user study, a qualitative analysis or through how the participants responded to the process and design.\nFor empirical research, you will have to identify an appropriate domain and work-related context to study (Button and Sharrock 2009). This typically involves studying how people work with X, their activities, tools and challenges using qualitative research methods. You will spend time doing field work, identifying appropriate ways of analysing the insights and develop rich descriptions and/or design implications.\nSome projects combine elements from the above. Every project develop differently.\nFor data-centric projects exploring interaction techniques, I recommend chosing a startning point from each perspective below:\n\nA step in the data analysis process: discovery, exploration, wrangling, analysis and/or presentation\nA genre of interaction techniques: traditional user interface, visual programing or interaction, physicalizations, sketching, colleborative, natural language, embodied interaction etc?\nData set/platform: traffic-, weather-, energy-, statistical-, cultural-, political-, bibliographic or other data.\n\n\n\nDeveloping the problem statement\nThe first step is to develop a problem statement. I follow the approach outlined in the book “Craft of Research” (Booth et al. 2016) on moving from topics to questions to problems (section II). Before we start the project, I will guide you in and ask you to write a short half/full page synopsis outlining the project. The synopsis should contain the following elements:\n\nTitle\nMotivation\nProblem-statement\nMethodology\nPlan\nShort literature review\n\nThis sounds like a lot, but it should not be. It is a sketch (but not incoherent or unclear) of the project. It should not contain answers, but questions and ideas about where to start informing these questions. The intention is to help you identify the following:\n\nWhat is the current focus of the project?\nWhy (do you think) this is important?\nWhat is the methodology and plan for the project?\nWhat do you know right now?\nWhat do you not know right now – what are the important questions and steps?\n\nThis helps us identify the starting point of the project. And more importantly, if you cannot write a short synopsis on something you intend to spend a semester on – how are you going to complete the project and write up the final assignment?\n\n\nProject and supervision\nYou will start the project from the synopsis. The task is to expand it into a full assignment that can be evaluated and graded towards the end. This has to happen in parallel with the project activities (the prototyping, design project or empirical work) to ensure that the document is updated and grows as you start honing in on the problem and begin to find answers.\nI will be stressing working on writing on the synopsis and paper througout the project, because I so often see students spend all the time on prototyping or designing, and then forgetting to document and update the project. Remember, the reason why you prototype, design or study people is to inform the final report. We cannot grade you on code or designs alonge. You cannot write a good final assignment in the final week (where you are also finishing up other activities).\n\nProcess and milestone\nWhen I supervise there are certain milestones I encurage the students to follow (see table 1 below). It is important to write stuff down when you can and not when you have to; it is important that the right steps inform the next steps. Within the first couple of weeks, you should be ready to start drafting:\n\nIntroduction and problem statement\nRelated work\nMethodology section\n\nDepending on the chosen approach, additional milestones include:\n\nConstructive: Describing the prototype / implementation\nConstructive: Describe the study design\nEmpirical / design: Describe the context, activities and users\nDesign: Document and describe the design process\nEmpirical: Introduce and describe the theoretical / analytical framing\n\nTowards the end, all projects will have to focus on: - Present and analyse results - Discussing what this means for the work, problem statement and the topic\nWe will schedule meetings througout the project following the milestones above, the project needs and where you are in the project.\nWhile projects develop differently, the milestones are important in aligning expectations. It is important that you start developing the background sections (introduction, related work, methodology) as early as possible. You cannot progress meaningfully before you have an idea of the project focus and background.\n\nTable 1: Project milestone overview – mileage and order may vary depending on project (and ambition level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\nProject type\nProject focus\n\n\n\n\n1\nConstructive\nIdentifying technical setup and resources\n\n\n1\nDesign\nIdentify focus and recrut participants\n\n\n1\nEmpirical\nDevelop methodology and recruit participants\n\n\n1\nM1: All\nDraft introduction, related work/background and methodology\n\n\n2\nConstructive\nFirst “hello world” prototype/demonstrator\n\n\n2\nDesign\nContextual inqury and workshops\n\n\n2\nEmpirical\nField work, analysis and reading\n\n\n2\nM2: All\nUpdate drafts, describe context, activities\n\n\n3\nConstructive\nIdentify prototypes and develop these\n\n\n3\nDesign\nCo-design activities and protyping\n\n\n3\nEmprical\nField work, continued\n\n\n3\nM3:All\nDraft assignment structure and table of contents\n\n\n3\nM3: Constructive\nIdentify and develop study design\n\n\n3\nM3: Design\nIdentify final design and evaluation\n\n\n3\nM3: Empirical\nIdentify analytical themse and theory\n\n\n4\nConstructive\nIterate final prototype, plan and recruit for user study, conduct user study\n\n\n4\nDesign\nDevelop final design and evaluated\n\n\n4\nEmpirical\nFollow-up activities, developing themes, write analysis\n\n\n4\nM4: Constructive/Design\nFinish prototype and evaluation\n\n\n4\nM4: Empirical\nFinish all data collection\n\n\n5\nM5: All\nWRITE, EDIT, WRITE, POLISH\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on expectations\nThere is a clear division of labour and responsibility. The student is responsible for doing the work, bring attention to challenges and barriers, and ask for help with particularities. This includes paying attention to deadlines, deliverables, local rules for student projects etc. My role as a supervisor is to supervise the student and project towards the best possible result.\nMy supervision tend to follow the progression of the work. This also means that if there is a lot of progress, then I am more available for supervision. If you do not make progress, then it is better to cancel a meeting and do the work, than us discussing the lack of progress (unless there are reasons for the lack of progress that you need supervision on)."

    "title": "Conversation about HCI interdisciplinarity, its ‘core’, pedagogy and being kicked around by technology",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: This is a repost from the Medium post for archival purpose and to play around with the format.\nThis post is an attempt to summarise a conversation between Stuart Reeves and Henrik Korsgaard that took place in Aarhus, Denmark, on the 2nd of November 2022. Our discussion was broadly animated by a couple of concerns. Firstly, the long-running conversation in HCI about its ‘status’ (as a field, as a discipline, as a respectable pursuit within the academic superstructure) and its constitution (as an un-/non-discipline and as concerns its interdisciplinarity). And secondly, the overall feeling of what it’s like being ‘kicked around’ by technology, which we sensed much of HCI (and other fields) have experienced for a long time (including ourselves). The conversation is depicted here as a series of turns between Henrik and Stuart but this is mainly for the purposes of presentation. In reality, Henrik initiated some notes, and Stuart then provided further commentary on the notes.\nHenrik: What do we mean by theory and why do we need it? There are two challenges here. First, pedagogy (the second being collective memory within our field, I will return to that). What do you teach from HCI research within a CS program? While there are many available textbooks, they are often design and technology centric and do not constrain a strain or common core of HCI theories. I jokingly say that there are more pictures of technology in our textbooks than references to evidence-based research and theory. Other fields have classics that present how the discipline or field developed and used to think about particular matters. They are still taught either as an introduction to more complex ideas or as part of becoming a member of a particular discipline. A typical example is that we are still teaching Newtonian ideas as partly introductory (because they are accurate enough for most people) and as understanding the history of physics, before progressing to more complex stuff. We also discussed parallels to psychology that also engage with old ideas in classics (see Green, 1997) as a background to understanding traditions and more recent ideas. Thomas Kuhn (1970) talks a lot about textbooks as a way to understand current paradigm of a particular field, as a source of authority, and when there is a paradigm shift, they retain some of the history of the field and a sense of discipline:\n“Textbooks thus begin by truncating the scientist’s sense of his discipline’s history and then proceed to supply a substitute for what they have eliminated. Characteristically, textbooks of science contain just a bit of history, either in an introductory chapter or, more often, in scattered references to the great heroes of an earlier age. From such references both students and professionals come to feel like participants in a long-standing historical tradition.” (Kuhn, 1970, p. 137)\nI guess, what I am missing here is not only a technology-centric history and/or tradition (remember, Grudin (1990) “The Computer Reaches Out” is about interfaces and not the theories and concepts used to make sense of these changes).\nStuart: We started this discussion initially because of your immediate practical concerns about teaching. I think I faced similar fundamental problems (and reflections on ways to move forwards with these problems) when teaching an introductory HCI module some time ago. Teaching HCI leads you to question how the mass of complexity of a whole research field’s work gets packaged up in a ‘textbook’ way for students. This then makes you wonder “what is at the core of HCI and how stable, substantial, and consistent is it?”“. You think”why aren’t there these books that everyone knows in common which I can point to as eternal features of a shared intellectual landscape?““. The first question that springs to mind is whether the ‘textbook’ view of research is similar to or representative of the lived experience of it as part of a community of researchers? Are we fooling ourselves into dreaming of a thing that never was? It is true that there are probably fewer ‘classic texts’ which can provide the level of ongoing intellectual nourishment that other fields benefit from. But maybe this is a function of the technology driving things rather than ideas driving things? The second thing that this conversation here assumes (or at least doesn’t draw attention to) a certain intellectual arrangement of universities, institutions etc. that have a history of specific ways of interrogating and arranging things like ‘disciplines’. HCI and its pedagogy, its forebears, the institutional and cultural situation it finds itself in is a product of that environment and the cultures it has emerged from (many of which are rightly being challenged today). The third thing to mention is that SIGCHI has had an Education Task Force for some time, and EduCHI is now a thing. There’s been prior work here e.g., started by Jenny Preece, Anne Bowser and Elizabeth Churchill some time ago (Churchill et al., 2013). I’m not sure how this conversation connects with that (yet). Finally I want to say that the go-to analogy is physics and we reach for it immediately here. I don’t think you are implying that there is somehow some commensurability, but rather the general perceived sense of ‘stability’ is an important component of the trouble sensed with HCI. I characterise this as ‘trouble’ but we should remember that trouble is not necessarily there to be ‘solved’ (see Reeves & Beck, 2019).\nYou also mention discipline. But there are many basic things which HCI researchers do not agree upon or align on. To me the only points of agreement (and maybe even this is wrong) is that HCI is ‘about’ technology (usually interactive in some way) and design. The rest is up for discussion. Even notions about ‘interactivity’ are themselves in question. Further, as you point out, the history of HCI shapes both its biases, its homes, and its relationships to pedagogy (and cultural differences therein). In the UK, my understanding is that HCI is mostly (mostly!) in a strong relationship with computer science, psychology, human factors, and perhaps also mathematics. There are few historic routes in the UK to HCI that I know of which have come via communication studies, for example, that we see elsewhere like the USA. Maybe Europe is the same? This then informs the shape of HCI in the UK, its recruitment, its structure, organisation, funding models, outcomes, etc. These are choices that have been made bit by bit and yet their broader import and cultural significance with respect to ‘the discipline’ is often not foregrounded or remarked upon much.\nHenrik: We touched upon recent discussions circulating around the lack of common motor themes in HCI (Kostakos, 2015; Liu et al., 2014) and tensions and challenges from being an interdisciplinary field (Blackwell, 2015; Reeves, 2015). The keyword analysis of Liu et al. (2014) - and relatedly, Kostakos (2015) - and the reported the lack of “motor themes” may be methodologically misdirected, but they point to something that is missing in HCI research (see also Oulasvirta & Hornbæk, 2016). What the missing component is, is open. Even the question whether HCI needs some common core or motor themes is debatable. I guess what I feel is missing (and it is a feeling and experience, not something I can firmly back up) is something enduring whether we call it classics, motor themes (based on something else than keywords), theory, concepts, canonical examples for textbooks (again, Kuhn would say that a paradigm in textbooks do not separate the theory from the canonical examples from the canonical exercises). Here, I come back to the question of theory. To me, theory plays an important role as a field or disciplines collective memory. It saves the phenomenon between the concrete and the abstract. It helps us avoid the ‘nomadic’ life Kostakos presents. And it can help us repeat work, perpetually starting from first principles etc.\nStuart: I dislike the scientism of Kostakos and Liu et al. and the method; there are fairly obvious possible ‘cores’ (subcommunities, shared interests, common orientations, etc.) one could easily point to, simply by being a researcher involved in HCI for enough time. Pretending that we cannot do that unless it is part of a ‘scientific analysis’ is to my mind extremely limiting. I also think that the notion of ‘accumulation’ - unstated but nevertheless runs through our discussion - needs to be reflected upon as a ‘science norm’ which may be based on a specific ‘picture’ of research activity (see Feyerabend (1975), and Kuhn of course). And being reflective scholars we should be cognisant of the manner of our investigations too (the big E word, i.e., ‘epistemology’). Thus, treating HCI unreflectively as compared with a picture of ‘normal science’ isn’t really a useful way to think about what HCI could possibly be / be doing. That said, the ‘trouble’ Kostakos and many others seem to feel is nevertheless genuinely felt even if the mode of dealing with it is - in my mind - misguided. I’d also add that the whole discourse on this ‘meta HCI’ stuff - how we each think about our research and what doesn’t get put into papers - is nevertheless vital to properly understand HCI. This stuff is not in the research record. These are more like ‘pub debates’ i.e., things left for the interstitial moments of research life - after all, research is communities of practice too. To not acknowledge that is to ignore a huge chunk of the mundane reality of research activity, just as it is to ignore its many political or cultural aspects.\nYou suggest that theory may be described as collective memory. It may be that HCI does actually ‘do’ what people would comfortably call ‘theory’, yet does not label it as such. Thus by foregrounding particular things (application, domain, technology, etc.) we may be missing what are actually aspects that do act as a ‘core’ for some people (i.e., reframing things dissolves the perceived ‘problem’). This goes back to HCI’s attitudes towards technology - and the tail wagging the dog. HCI’s beholdenness to tech may disguise parts of its collective programme that are actually substantially contributing to ‘theory’, thus also feeding into the concerns about ‘theory’ and ‘cores’. Finally, I note that some years ago there were increased challenges to the role of corporations at CHI, such as industry sponsorship and so on. I wonder how the specific US (and European) biases of CHI and the structures, organisations of things that this bias has maybe promoted contribute to a kind of atmosphere where the ‘core’ becomes a problem. Here we loop back to a critique familiar to us all of which focus on specific ways of knowing, of which a concern for ‘theory’ features heavily.\nHenrik: We often have to repeat and account for aspects of methodology, epistemology, traditions and theoretical orientations that we feel should be somewhat established now, 50 some years into HCI research. There is a sense that, given the strong commitment to design (implications) and informing HCI practitioners, years of insights remain local to particular topics and individual studies. This may also be unevenly distributed, in the sense that user studies and laboratory experiments feel more established than for instance ethnomethodological work and theoretical work.\nStuart: As Taylor (2015) has argued, there is a particular “default mode” of HCI which he calls “Engelbartian interaction”. This means some things are left unexplicated because that is just ‘normal HCI’. Other approaches have to be constantly justified because they breach various unstated norms and taken-for-grantedness. We could connect this back to our discussion about the history of HCI, geographic distribution, etc., and how that particular path or set of paths taken by different communities has led us to this point. At this moment since you mention it we should also talk practice and practitioners, particularly HCI’s relationship to ‘them’ (as a monolith) and industry. Often I think industry doesn’t care much about HCI even though HCI wants its love to be sent to ‘the practitioners’. This relates back to your point about ‘classic texts’ and pedagogy. Our impacts in HCI are very heavily on practitioners but probably not in any direct sense HCI typically conceives as ‘for practitioners’. We collectively train many of them in our degree and masters programmes - this is real, but long-term impact which takes career lengths to actually come to fruition. If we teach them in a way that renders HCI research inchoate and (for want of a better word) ‘scatty’, or subject to the whims of technology and its market infrastructures, then what long-term, deeper orientations are we leaving them with for the rest of their lives when things no doubt change? Will we just leave them chasing surfaces - vagaries of technologies - and not underlying concepts?\nHenrik: So, back to that which may be missing. We cannot pinpoint directly what is missing, but some enduring constructs, synthesis work and a more grounded understanding of the full range of HCI methodology seem to be what the conversation lingers around. I suggest that theory should step into this space as something enduring (that is the role theory has played in other fields). It is striking that contemporary contributions still lament that the field cannot account for basic phenomena (Hornbæk & Oulasvirta, 2017) or the state of these constructs (Reeves & Beck, 2019). Again, the missing bit or hole in HCI research creates trouble for the field. Internally, because it is hard to synthesise work into teachable constructs, compare decades of effects proven in the lab, themes from the field and ideas. When other areas look to HCI research for answers, models and principles, it is unclear to us where they should look and what they will find.\nStuart: You raise a point about appearances, not only practical problems introduced by the needs of pedagogy (and the specific structures / arrangements / assumptions within that sits, situated within - in our limited experience - (specific) European contexts) - but also issues of respectability, how HCI ‘looks’ to others outside of HCI. It should be the case that we can openly talk about how these typically unvoiced concerns may play a role in the discussion here, and the drives towards producing what you call “the enduring”.\nHenrik: Yes, and not only respectability. Depending on how one counts, HCI is a field with 50+ history and work (I typically count from Licklider (1960), because I like the paper. Others might count from the first CHI conference). So when other areas encounter challenges, they may look to us for answers - theories, constructs, guidance. There are many contemporary challenges where we face problems that HCI and CSCW should have some textbook answers to. The massive and hastily migration to remote work under COVID19 for instance. Where are the synthesis insights, models, recommendations, theories for designers and engineers at Zoom, Gathertown, Discord, Slack, Miro to scrutinise to develop better support for everything remote? People working on remote work prior to COVID19 often had problems convincing reviewers of the relevance.\nOr with the increased trend of having prompt-based command line interactions with ML models (so-called prompt-based learning), where is the synthesis (and continued) work on command line interaction? Similarly, work on Human-AI collaboration in Nature seems to have ignored both HCI and CSCW (e.g. Dafoe et al., 2021; Reverberi et al., 2022). Maybe they had a quick look and concluded they were better off starting from scratch. Or when Infovis started to look at interaction as important, it seems like they had to do a first-principle approach instead of learning from HCI (see Yi et al. 2007). And what about newcomers to HCI? If you cannot easily get ‘some’ overview over ‘some’ parts of HCI without having to read Grudin, Bødker, Rogers, Shneiderman and multiple others in parallel, how do you contribute? Or rather, when Rogers says “anything goes in HCI research” (Rogers, 2012, p. xii), then it’s hardly surprising that people skip the classics to go for the quick contribution.\nWhile it is difficult to confidently and conclusively pin-point that something specific is missing, it is much easier to examine some of the reasons for the absence of more enduring constructs or commonly known HCI classics.\nStuart: On this point, there are papers which do try to do ‘meta theory’ or construct ‘meta taxonomies’ to arrange HCI work in response to these concerns about “enduring constructs”. Papers immediately that spring to mind are Turnhout et al. (2019) and Stolterman & Beck (2022), and various papers by Hornbaek & Oulasvirta. Sometimes HCI textbooks try to do this implicitly by virtue of their way of arranging HCI into something ‘readable’. But the central problem facing this task is that of incommensurability. In other words, I think HCI is just the community interface where we share ideas, but owing to HCI’s non-disciplinary nature, the ways we come to those ideas cannot come under some shared schema no matter how ‘meta’. That said, if we re-frame efforts to construct a ‘meta theory’ of HCI into something seemingly less grand but far more practical like ‘a tourism guidebook’ then we may benefit from the things which that analogy entails. Guidebooks try to be accurate but they do not present a grand theory of a city or other tourist destination. Guidebooks get out of date, but they still retain value, and even may provide historical significance some time later. They contain impressions and opinions on ways to engage with the location of interest, but they are not the only way to get value. They try to boil down complexity into something manageable. That said, the notion of the ‘HCI guidebook’ is still a bit different to your idea of ‘classics’.\nHenrik: I like the idea of a HCI guidebook for now. I do believe that there is a space for more theory and more pluralistic theory. And your point on incommensurability is key here. Right now I think that the HCI theory space suffers more from meaning variance and lack of well-described positions and constructs. Once some of this synthesis and theorising work develop more clearly, then, we can explore common philosophy of science issues as they face us. Incommensurabilities and other issues feel like a downstream topic and an entirely different conversation.\nHenrik: Kostakos (2015) identifies the strong focus on implications for design as problematic. We share that focusing on ‘HCI practitioners’ as a primary audience for direct research results is perhaps a bit of a misunderstanding in the field. Typically, one would expect that practitioners of a field get their knowledge and ideas from textbooks and lectures, and not through shifting through CHI proceedings for ‘strong concepts’ and ‘implications for design’. If we rely (only) on synthesising our knowledge as implications for design, these insights will suffer in multiple ways: They will likely remain local to particular research publications We have no tradition of or systematic ways of comparing insights (like other fields compare results, models and theories) They are likely (seen as) valid only to particular technologies or classes of technologies. And unless we are mistaken and the main readership of CHI proceedings is busy HCI folks in industry, then the most recognised epistemological construct in HCI research does not have an audience\nThis brings us to a final summary of the sense of something missing and/or why something is missing. We largely feel that HCI research is getting kicked around by technology. This is perhaps Kostakos’s point as well, but his analogy with nomads feel inadequate to our experiences. For the inventive part of HCI research, new technologies may bring excitement and opportunities for riding a new wave of novelty, relevance, funding and contributions. For us, the experience is different. One does not have to read that much outside HCI before the idea that ‘new’ technologies are rarely new (history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes; history of infrastructure and bureaucracy and computing and all that jazz). Except for a few radical inventions, technology is only new when deliberately positioned in an “we live in unprecedented times” / epochalism narrative (Morozov, 2013). Hence, the fascination with the ‘new’ often becomes an instance of having to relate to the ‘new’ in our own publications, funding proposals, institutions etc., while we at the same time must resist the temptation to critiquing the new, which distracts us from our own research.\nThe way we put technology front and centre in publication titles is another way we are being kicked around by technology. (And this is perhaps where Kostakos’s keyword analysis is hitting the actual problem.) Putting specific technologies (social media), specific instances of technologies (Facebook) or the catchy names of our own inventions in paper titles seem counterproductive to developing enduring constructs and classics that can speak to more than the latest technologies. We are hiding a lot of the contributions to our collective knowledge (whatever that is) in the deep end of our publications. How can you pick up an idea, theory, concept, implication etc. and engage productively with it, if finding things that speak to each other is almost impossible?\nStuart: To that I would add that while there are strong pockets of work within HCI that are definitely ‘kicking back’ at technology, almost everything seems to be working against us doing this. There is only a relatively small amount of work questioning the largely corporate-driven and individualist basis of most technologies that get play in HCI. I can point the finger directly at myself included in this regard - recently we have had a number of relatively successful studies of voice interfaces (e.g. Porcheron et al., 2018) - but you could quite reasonably critique this style of work as essentially glorified (albeit sceptical) product research. Much HCI is like this, unquestioning of the technical fundamentals which underpin and form core assumptions, even when this work is designated ‘critical’. Maybe I shouldn’t be so hard on this work - it is not unreasonable to explore the objects, infrastructures, systems in the world as you find them. Social computing has done a roaring trade in that. But, alternatives, different arrangements of and conceptions of technology seem to be rumbling there under the surface all the time. By that I mean state-, civic-, or community-oriented technologies - although considered in HCI’s body of work - nevertheless have this extant substrate to work with (devices, infrastructures), the assumptions of which - largely privatised, and individualised - bring their own difficulties when retooling for these alternate purposes.\nHenrik: I would like to make a final (post-conversation) note on some of these issues. It doesn’t have to be this way. There are multiple open questions and ambitions to work toward. I do not think that theory should replace anything, but I would also like to be able to work just on HCI theory as a more creative and indigenous genre of HCI contributions. CHI puts up a high bar for theory contributions. A high bar that does not leave room for creativity and experimentation with indigenous theory. Similarly, it is not given that HCI should maintain its fascination and uncritical stance toward industry or the very idea that HCI practitioners and companies are the sole or primary audience for HCI research. Finally, briefly returning to the question of discipline, interdiscipline or speciality. This is not given either. I think it is important to remember that when we give HCI attention in our educational programs and courses, we are also bringing up a new generation of researchers who may feel that this is more a pluralistic (inter)discipline than a meeting between multiple disciplines.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBlackwell, A.

    "text": "When I pay for electricity I pay one month in advance based on my estimated consumption and the estimated market price on electricity. If I consume more or less, or if the prices are higher or lower than expected, the difference in payment is adjusted for the coming months. Roughly translated, my bill looks something like this:\n\n\nDear customer\n\n\nIt is time to pay for your electricity at Denmarkstreet 10, 8100 Aarhus\n\n\n\n\n\nYour prepayment for the next period: 01.07.2022 – 31.07.2022\n\n\n\n\n\nWe estimate that you will use\n\n\n305.649 kWh\n\n\n1151.01 DKK\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consumption includes subscribtion and fixed fees.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour statement from last period: 01.06.2022 – 30.06.2022\n\n\n\n\n\nWe estimated you to use\n\n\n315.096 kWh\n\n\n1182.98 DKK\n\n\n\n\nYou used\n\n\n316.802 kWh\n\n\n1189.07 DKK\n\n\n\n\nDifference to be paid\n\n\n\n\n6.09 DKK\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consumption includes subscribtion and fixed fees.\n\n\nYour total payment (including vat) 1157.11 DKK\n\n\nNotice that you may experience a small difference between the totals and sums of each item, because the calculation is done using more decimal places than reflected on the bill.\n\n\nFrom a everyday case of interacting with data (and from a data design perspective), there are quite a few things to unpack. Let’s invent some design principles1.\n\nFirst principle: If you present the user with a prediction about consumption you have to explain the basis of that prediction.\nWhy? Because that will ensure transparency and allow the consumer to engage with the data, seek out more information and potentially use the information to act in their best interest. Secondly, one could argue that the right to an explanation is in effect here, given that there are financial implications, but that is just a detail.\nNow, what do the provider give in terms of information about the estimation? From the bill and the website, we learn that it is based on “my expected consumption and the expected price per kWH for the next period.” This is supplemented by a general statement about recent increase in prices and consumption: “if you experience your bill to be higher than usual in the coming montsh, it is because the prices on electricity has gone up in the last months. The winter season also impact your consumption leading to a higher electricity bill”\nWe do learn that the bill combines two estimates. They estimate my consumption and then the electricity price one month out. The first – consumption – I should be able to influence, so lets take a look at that. I went through all my bills back to April 2020 when they introduced the estimate model and collected the data.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nactual2021 = np.array([302.024,308.978,266.689,332.947,317.887,299.468,333.479,360.479,406.004])\npredicted2021 = np.array([288.835,290.35,257.746,274.158,317.961,314.396,383.261,380.969,422.834])\nactual2022 = np.array([413.49,347.342,342.519,321.065,335.04,316.802,254.906,308.2,280.031,294.629, 307])\npredicted2022 = np.array([430.406,364.626,354.423,340.85,330.57,315.096,305.642,309.731,313.22,336.317, 347.14])\n\nx2020 = np.arange(9)\nx2021 = np.arange(11)\n\nfig,axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10,5))\nfig.suptitle(\"Electricity consumption: Predicted (blue) versus actual (green) consumption\")\n#fig.ylabel(\"Kwh per month\")\n\naxes[0].plot(x2020, actual2021, color=\"green\")\naxes[0].plot(x2020, predicted2021, color=\"blue\")\naxes[0].set_ylabel(\"Kwh per month\")\naxes[0].set_xticks(np.arange(9), [\"Apr\",\"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\"])\naxes[0].set_title(\"2021\")\n\naxes[1].plot(x2021, actual2022, color=\"green\")\naxes[1].plot(x2021, predicted2022, color=\"blue\")\naxes[1].set_ylabel(\"Kwh per month\")\naxes[1].set_xticks(np.arange(11), [\"Jan\",\"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\"])\naxes[1].set_title(\"2022\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis indicates that the estimation is not particularly accurate. The example bill from June 2022 above is one of three where the estimation have been somewhat spot on (August 2021 and May 2022 are similar). Based on this, I tried to poke around with a bit of basic math to see if there was a pattern to the estimate, e.g. that they used my consumption from the same month last year, did some sort of mean across multiple years or months, or if there was some trend analysis going on.\nBased on this, I could not explain the estimate directly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI’m just pulling these out of thin, yet very experience, air. I will synthesise these and present more examples elsewhere↩︎"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Status: Rough draft!\nI am trying to understand and explore aspects of the peak-demand problem, in particular within the electricity grid from a household perspective. Peak-demand is when there is the highest amount of demand on the electricity system. This is typically when a large amount of consumers need energy at the same time. One famous example is the TV-surge in the UK, where there is a significant increase in demand created by people putting over a kettle as TV-shows end. The peak-demand problem introduces two1 related problems, that go into effect depending on local conditions. So, with this reference, I have tried to sketch peak versus non-peak below.\nFirst, peak-demand create a need for increasing production of energy. In traditional systems, the increase in demand might be anticipated and production can be increased. In systems that are based on unstable sources of energy (wind, sun, water), this can become a problem where auxiliary production is needed (peak power stations). Second, peak-demand introduces an increased load on the grid – for both transimission and local distribution. This increases the strain on the grid and transformer stations, and the local grid. While the kettle might introduce a significant increase already, I assume the problem will worsen if everyone come home and plug in an Electrical Vehicle (EV) at the same time (and we do not have an intelligent response in the grid and household). EVs draw significantly more power than kettles.\nI do not yet know if the peak demand problem is mostly challenging production or distribution. This likely depend on the local infrastructure, energy sources and demand patterns."

I have not considered increasing the capacity of the grid or production, as this makes little sense strategically (see Jevons Paradox and Khazzoom-Brookes postulate2)).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Peak options: a. Peak; b. Remove peak consumption; c. Move peak consumption; d. Stretch or soften peak (flatten the curve!)\n\n\nWe have three options:\n\nRemove peak consumption: Construct some intervention that remove the peak consumption. If I stop cooking my meals and just eat a sandwhich for dinner, then I’ve removed some consumption.\nMove peak consumption: Move the consumption to another time. If I start eathing dinner outside peak-hours, e.g. at 21, I have effectively removed (my consumption) from peak.\nDistribute consumption: Consider interventions that distributes the local consumption to flatten peak. This could be cooking earlier and then just reheat at dinner time.\n\nNow, there are two considerations here. First, the peak I showed above is my peak consumption. That is only important if it coincide with peak consumption in the part of the grid I’m part of (see figure 1). Second, and implied, moving can then either be considered a question of chaging my behaviour entirely or being flexible on a collective level. That is, I get to keep my peak consumption, I just have to move it."

    "text": "Status: Rough draft!\nTwo key trends offer an extraoridinary oppertunity for thinking about strategies for changing or helping people change their electricity consumption habits. First, the energy-crises means that prices are increasing and will fluctuate more often due to supply and demand. Second, the climate-crisis mean that more and more people share an interest in changing their ecological footprint and change their consumption behaviour1. That means that there are a lot of people who want to participate in understanding and changing their consumption habits – some motivated by economy and some by a moral standpoint.\nAt the same time, energy producers, grid companies and energy providers are investing billions into Smart grid solutions – using digitization, modelling, prediction etc. to make the best out of the current grid infrastructure in order to supply and increased demand. There are two key challenges: Dirst, switching to green energy mean changes in the supply side – energy when the wind is blowing and sun is shining – that does not always fit demand. Second, challenges on the demand side. Just like traffic there are peak consumption, in particular from households. We use power when we get up in the morning and when we come home and cook dinner. This consumption pattern is not as flexible as we imagine – kids go to school at the same time and most families have to cook between 17 - 19. Generally speaking, out habits are collective. And it might worsen when everyone switches to electrical cars – what happens when everyone return home and plug in their EV at the same time? Peak is gonna happen. And peak is bad – the energy need surges and the infrastructure is struggling to meet the demands at the neccesary throughput."

    "text": "So, what can we do about it?\nPersonally, I think a lot can be done (and a lot is being done). The smartgrid efforts will likely optimize our infrastructure as best as possible (save Jevons Paradox and Khazzoom-Brookes postulate2). Still, there are lot of strategies to visit and revisit on the consumer side, in particular for households (to address the peak-problem) and small and medium sized business (SMVs).\nGiven the number of consumers interested in contributing, I think a user-centered approach should supplement the producer- and grid-centered (system-centered) approach. And to develop successful intervention, we need to consider it as a partnership with empasis on dialogue and mutual learning. This points to participatory and co-design approches. But before we go into that, we need to examine the existing strategies."

    "text": "Understanding different strategies\n\n\n\nSketch: Strategies for changing consumption behaviour\n\n\nIn the figure above, I have tried to sketch a intervention space and plot in different strategies. There are five strategies3. Each strategy have a role to play, but operates with different assumptions and effects. I have split the space into a producer- and consumer side; and user-centered and system-centered approches.\n\nNothing (or optimizing the Smart Grid)\nThe first one is the current dominant strategy in terms of research, development and investment. The consumers will consume, while the producers and grid operators invest deeply into optimizing the infrastructure and production to meet changing demands.\nThe orientation toward the consumer, is as a consumer, and the efforts to understand consumption behaviour is approached from the perspective of understanding the consumption in the grid and modelling consumer behaviour as group behaviour (cittion needed). As said, this is a very important effort, but it will not provide the gains needed without other efforts.\n\n\nRegulating consumption through pricing\nAnother common and current strategy is to regulate energy-consumption is through dynamic pricing. As the energy market changes, so does the consumer pricing. A more recent initiative in Denmark, is to increase the price between 17 and 20, in hopes that this will motivate consumers to move their flexible consumption to another hour (citation needed). This is clearly to address the peak-problem.\nThe is an effective strategy, because we know that economic incentives work (citation needed). However, while this strategy likely impacts all consumers, it will affect low-income groups more (citation needed). And since only a marginal part of the consumption (laundry) is flexible, it is hard to move a significant amount of consumption, unless skipping hot meals and turning of the refrigerator.\n\n\nNudging consumers\nThe pricing model described above will incentify consumers to change some of their behaviour. A popular term for this is to ‘nudge’ consumers. That is to use means to manipulate consumers into changing their behaviour. I have seperated this strategy from the above, because pricing is unavoidable, whereas nudging is a strategy that can be initiated in addition. Nudging can come in the form of reminders, competition, awards etc. geared toward promoting specific behaviours. It is different from education and information-driven intiatives, because the consumer does not neccesarily need to know or link the aspects of the nudging-campain with the intended behaviour change.\nFrom the figure, we can notice that the nudging strategy have moved from the producer side to the consumer side. Whereas pricing is set at the producer side, nudging initiatives are most powerful within the context where the behaviour-change need to happen.\nResearch on nudging and energy https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300383\n\n\nInformation\nOn the user-centered side we have strategies that focus on providing target information and advice for consumers.\nParagraf 14\n\n\nConsultancy"

    "text": "Data reflect the world and the systems that generate it. A lot of the patterns that can be identified using various analytic methods are not surprising, but quite obvious if looking at the practices producing the data. In many ways, it makes more sense to talk about rhythms and routines when considering patterns in data. The patterns are weak or strong signals, or residue or traces of the people and practices, and not isolated patterns only visible in the data. This note is part about me learning to use D3 to visualize data and part of me trying to figure out if our electricity consumption follows the annual changes in daylight.\n\nData on electricity consumption\nIn Denmark, anyone can download data on their electricity consumption from El Overblik. You can download data for your household meter with a resolution from the year, over month and day, to an hour and even every 15 minutes in some cases.

With the bright summer nights, we need less light and as the days get shorter towards the winter we need more. This assumes that a significant amount of our electricity is consumed by sources that somehow map to this rhythm. Lights are one source, but indoor entertainment (gaming, streaming, television, etc.) would also increase during the winter.\nIt is easy to observe the rhythm of the daylight changes in Figure 1, but the correlation with energy consumption is less obvious. Or rather, the erratic nature of the energy data obscures whatever might be there. It looks like the summer months are slightly below the 10 kwhs line, with the spring and fall months sitting on the line, and the winter months moving slightly above the 10 kwhs line. Turns out that when computing the correlation coefficient (r=0.243, see below), then there is hardly any correlation between daylight and electricity consumption data.\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrelation_coeffecient = {\n\n    const kwhs_array = days.map(d =>{\n        return d.kwhs\n    })\n\n    const daylight_array = days.map( d =>{\n        return d.daylight\n    })\n\n    const correlation = simplestats.sampleCorrelation(kwhs_array,daylight_array)\n    return correlation\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile dissapointed that the visualisation does not show a clear pattern, this also hightligt the benefits of visualising the data. While the correlation coefficient tell me that there is no correlation between daylight and electricity consumption, the visualisation (and making it) has a lot of additional benefits:\n\nI am learning useful information about the particular data from crafting the visualisation. Information that is useful for future experiments and visualisations.\nThe visualisation and data forces me to reflect on my hypothesis and look for alternative explanations\nThe visualisation provide hints and information useful for speculating about explanations on the relationship between consumption and annual patterns.\n\n\n\nSo, why does our annual electricity consumption not correlate with available daylight?\nThe hypothesis assumes that a significant amount of our electricity consumption goes to sources that decrease with an increase in available daylight and increase when it gets darker outside during the winther. That would mostly be electrical lights and indoor entertainment. First, I do not think that lights account for a significant amount of our consumption. This would go to refriguation, laundry and cooking. On top of that, most of our indoor lighting is LED based which consume only a few watts per unit per hour and our use of entertainment likely only changes marginally from summer to winther. I still play computer games and we still stream during the summer.\nThis pose an interesting question. We are often told that private consumers should change habits and implement various micro-initiatives as part of solutions toward the climate and energy crisis. While some initatives do work, the savings seem minimal. My guestimate is that we can properly optimize our consumption to save a couple of kilowatts per day at most. A lot of our consumption is not something we can change at the moment. We still need a freezer and refrigerator, and we need to cook meals. A lot of larger initiatives do not make economic sense. So, is it even possible to optimize household consumption in a meaningful way so it contributes to lowering the energy demand? I do not think so. Not without heavy economic incentives. I will try to explore everyday habits, theoretical savings and impact in a future post.\n\n\nShow the code\nsimplestats = require(\"simple-statistics@7\")\n// Loading our data file\ndays = FileAttachment(\"/public/data/el-consumption-days-all.csv\").csv({typed:true}).then(raw => {\n    var lat = 56.16, long=10.20\n    \n    //We want to simplify our objects and translate the values into appropriate formats.\n    //We keep the date and the value\n    raw = raw.filter(o => {\n        var str = o[\"Fra_dato\"].substring(6,10)\n        return o[\"Type\"] === \"Tidsserie\" && str != \"2017\"\n    })\n\n    raw = raw.map(o => {\n        // Create a data object\n        var dstr = o[\"Fra_dato\"].replace(\" 00:00:00\", \"\").split(\"-\")\n        var date = new Date(`${dstr[2]}-${dstr[1]}-${dstr[0]}`)\n      \n        //Create object for date\n            //Including data on the hours of the day\n        var sun = SunCalc.getTimes(new Date(date), lat,long)\n        var daylight = (sun.sunset - sun.sunrise) / 1000 / 60\n\n        var v = typeof o[\"Mængde\"] == \"string\" ? parseInt(o[\"Mængde\"]) : o[\"Mængde\"]\n\n        return {date: date, kwhs:v, daylight:daylight}\n    \n    })\n\n    //Sorting dates because the order is messy after conversion from object to array\n    raw.sort((a,b) => {\n        return a[\"date\"] > b[\"date\"]\n    })\n\n    return raw\n})"

    "text": "A couple of scenarios to get us started\nI’m using a scenario-based approach to design[3], where the first goal is to develop a scenario that describes the current situation. Secondly, we will generate a couple of future scenarios. These scenarios will help us anchor the design in the present and address concrete needs, and explore future solutions that allow us identify and make early decisions on design features, technologies, critical prototypes and bootstrapping user-stories.\nHenrik (that’s me) is a 40-some white male who work as a researcher at a Computer Science department in the city. He lives in suberbia outside the city with his family. Every morning, Henrik get up around 6, do a short run, and then shower and eats. He helps his family get ready and some days he walks the dog. He usually leave for work between 8 and 9 in the morning (except when he is teaching early) and leaves for home around 16. He wants to commute more often, as a flexible option and to lower his CO2 footprint. However, planning the commute and experiences with frequent delays and lost connections make him chose the comforts of his car over public transport.\nThat gives us a bit of information on the context, the user and the challenge. Here are two future scenarios:\nHenrik is getting ready in the morning. His smartwatch notifies him that the bus for work is leaving in 15 minutes, so he has to walk in 5 minutes to catch it. He snoozes the notification. 4 minutes later the notification goes off again. Henrik decides that he is not ready yet, so he press next on the smart watch app. 10 minutes later, his Garmin smartwatch notifices him that the train is leaving in 15 minutes, so he has to walk in 5 minutes to catch it. He cancels the notification and pack the last things in his back. 5 minutes later he leaves for the train.\nHenrik is at work. He promised his familty that he would be home by 17. Around 16 his watch notifies him that a train is leaving in 20 minutes, so he has to walk in 5 minutes to catch it. He presses `next’ and the watch shows that a bus is leaving in 30 minutes. He presses ‘accept’ on his smartwatch. 10 minutes later the smartwatch reminds him that he needs to walk within 5 minutes to catch the bus. On the way to the bus, the watch notifies him that the bus is 5 minutes delayed.\nThese scenarios allow us to discuss and think about the design before we make too many decisions about the solution. Scenarios are excellent for early internal and external feedback. We can discuss them in our design team, with users, clients, developers and other stakeholders. We can invite users into the process and ask them to inform or co-write scenarios. Scenarios can be acted out and explored through embodied and contextual design methods, and we can develop scenarios as sketches, story-boards and even short movies to help illustrate the future use. If future users recognize their situation in the current scenario and agree that the future scenario is a compelling solution, then we have a good stakeholder alignment and can proceed."

    "text": "A bit of early software architecture\nThe requirement list above is not complete and a bit abstract. And the list format is not telling about the relationship between the design features of the application. We need a bit more detail before we can start writing code. While UX folks might start developing user journeys or interface sketches, or even better user stories, we need to do some high-level sketching of the software architecture to figure out the building blocks of our application, where the user interacts with the system, critical parts that needs to be prototyped and figured out etc. All this would happen anyways as a consequence of the obvious user story “the user wants to define frequently used transit routes based on location and time of day”. And likely, a lot of this will happen either in parallel with close coordination or in a series of design meetings in the release planning part of the agile process[2].\nWhen sketching high-level architecture, I’ve started using the C4 Model approach as a way to visualise the relationship between requirements, application design and software architecture3. For this application, it makes sense to sketch out the context and container level because the application draw on a couple of external services.\nSketching out the context includes the people (actors, roles, personas etc.) and the software systems that build up the application and and the context. This include additional systems the users and future system interacts with.The container diagram are the neccesary building blocks that provides the services that the system would offer. This level focus on high-level technologies and seperated deployable units such as a service, database, web-application etc. Containers can then be further decomposed into a component (modules) design for each container and subsequently into the familiar code-level diagrams from the UML family4\nThe diagrams can move from sketches (that is how I use them right now) to documentation that reflects how the actual system work. While some of the diagrams do show stuff that a sequence diagram would also capture once we know how everything will work, context and container diagrams provide a better way of sketching rough ideas and what we currently know about the application than traditional UML (in my opinion).\n\nContext diagram\nThe context diagram allow us to focus on the user and application, and the other systems that they interact with as part of the use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n1\n\n Henrik [Person] A user of the Garmin GTFS notification app   \n\n4\n\n Garmin Connect [Software System] Garmin smartphone application for distributing smartwatch applications   \n\n1->4\n\n  Install Garmin app on smartwatch.   \n\n6\n\n Garmin App [Software System] Provides personalized public transit notifications.

A bit of research reveal that Garmin use their Connect IQ application (for Android and iOS) to distribute smartwatch applications. When installed on the watch, the Connect IQ shows the application on your smartphone and provide ways of configuring the application. This way, the user avoid having to do the personalization on a small device like a smartwatch and can leverage the larger display, better input and network connection of their smartphone.\nThe requirements also tell us that we need some external services. One for getting all the information on public transit and one for estimating time and distance from the user location to the nearest stop. We can get the public transit data from the Danish provider of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data RejsePlanen. For walking time and distance estimation, we can use on of several distance API providers:\n\nGoogle Distance API\nGraphhopper API\nOpenRouteservice API\nOther OSM based services\n\nWhich one will likely be determined depending on pricing and developer usability, i.e. how easy it is to integrate the API.\n\n\nContainer diagram\nContainer diagrams show the different independent units (e.g. a separate processes) that executes code or stores data5. If we zoom in one level, we get more details about the bits and pieces that needs to be developed in the applications. We are still not dealing with neither components (e.g. a location-based service component) or the actual implemented code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\ncluster_6\n\n Garmin App [Software System]   \n\n1\n\n Henrik [Person] A user of the Garmin GTFS notification app   \n\n4\n\n Garmin Connect [Software System] Garmin smartphone application for distributing smartwatch applications   \n\n1->4\n\n  Install Garmin app on smartwatch.   \n\n8\n\n Webapplication [Container: JavaScript] A web application that helps the user define their preferences by providing IF-THIS-THEN-THAT rules for the garmin app.   \n\n1->8\n\n  Create IF-THIS-THEN-THAT rules   \n\n2\n\n RejsePlanen API [Software System] GTFS data API.

    "section": "Instrumental interaction with databases",
    "text": "Instrumental interaction with databases\nOne of the most fundamental ways to interact with data is by using the Structured Query Language (SQL). Together with the relationel database, it was developed to help “the non-professional user into effective communication with a formatted database” (Chamberlin & Boyce, 1974, p. 250) and “to put end users into direct touch with the information stored in computers” (Codd, 2007, p. 109). SQL was considered an ideal way for non-programmers to access and query data. It was developed with an onset in English (Structured English Query Language – SEQUEL) and a declarative approach to data querying. While SQL turned out to be hugely succesful (Helland, 2016) and is one of the commonly used technologies today. However, the vision that the casual user without programming experience would use SQL to interact with databases on a frequent basis have not come true (yet).\n\n\nInteraction 1: SQL shell connected to a publication database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the interactive example above, you can use SQL as an instrument1 for interacting with the database. Try it – click on the terminal above and start typing. You can also click on the SQL code fields below and see the result.\nSELECT * FROM publications LIMIT 5;\nWhen we have to interact with an unfamiliar and undocumented database (like this one), we try to use the instrument to poke around to explore and discover how the data is organized and how to query for the information we need. This often involves multiple steps of trail-and-error to identify appropriate tables, their fields, relations and data:\nSELECT name FROM sqlite_master;\nSELECT * FROM authors LIMIT 5;\nSELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE name='authors';\nAnd you can do more complex stuff like querying multiple tables for specific results:\nSELECT publications.title, authors.first, authors.last, publications.year FROM publications INNER JOIN authorship ON publications.wid=authorship.wid INNER JOIN authors ON authorship.aid=authors.aid WHERE authors.last='Dewey'; \n\nTODO: Interactive quiz SQL -> Database quiz\n\nSQL as an instrument for interacting with data\nI know, I know – SQL has language in its name. How is it an instrument then2? It is a formal language that can be used to communicate between entities that can interpret it. However, it is not a natual language and the query formulation problem – the act of translating a question from a natural language into a formalized language – is a still a challenging problem under research (Hofstede et al., 1996; Papenmeier et al., 2020). I am not sure recasting SQL from a language to an instrument will resolve the query formulation problem, but thinking about it conceptually can be illuminating (which I will return to below)\nThere are many small signs that one could discuss SQL as an instrument. It is an invention, a technology that has undergone significant development since its inception in 1975. Knowing how to use3 SQL is also a highly valuable skill4 and it is something that needs to be learned in order to use it proficiently, and the way we learn it is through using it.\nThese losely collected observations are just hints. The main reason I think it makes sense to consider SQL as an instrument is that SQL is a means to an end; we use SQL on a database towards a desired outcome. If we venture a bit into activity theory,\nVygotsky has his famous -> continue from slides\nWe know it’s at tool because so much is about using: query formulation problem or query writing challenge.\n\n\nWhat does considering SQL as an instrument do for us?\n\nFirst, if SQL is an instrument for interacting with data, why should it be constrained to databases?\nSecond,\n\nI consider Instrumental Interaction a “foot in the door” to a significant class of topics and problems that are highly relevant to Human-Data Interaction, and can be solved to the benefit of…\n\nActivity theory – what if the query formulation problem is a too parter: A guestion of familiarity with the instrument and the object it is used upon: SQL as a means to explore querying (SQL),\nQuery formulation problem, not as something that can be solved by building better technologies (SQL, tools for exploration etc), but a fundamental dialectical interacition (dialogue with resistance/trial and error ->\n\nTrial-and-error as a phenomenon Trial-and-error as prototyping Trial-and-error as experiment Trial-and-error as seeing-moving-seeing (Schön -> consider also the Alan Dix paper) <- this is the pragmatism angle Trial-and-error as failure or inability (this is the anti-thesis)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this note I am trying to identify a useful design or process model for Human-Data Interaction. I am not going to claim that HDI need a process model that stand a part from all the others, rather I would argue that we need an integrative one given that HDI is defined as “the human manipulation, analysis and sense-making of data.” Elmqvist (2011). My own interest can be formulated as the challenge of asking good questions to data, or rather, supporting citizens in asking good questions to public data. This involves examining the genesis of the question (information need) and how this interacts with data and the answer, and the process in between. A process model is useful tool in many ways:\nBecause different disciplines are concerned with different stages and have identified specific challenges and solutions, a process model is a tool for identifying and organize particular challenges, prior work, useful techniques and representations across multiple perspectives. For instance, knowledge discovery concerns itself with the early part of the data analytics process (Fayyad et al. 1996), (visual) analytics with the middle part (Sacha et al. 2014) and information visualization with the presentation (McKenna et al. 2014). None of these areas ignore the other steps, but take particular interest in challenges and solutions for a few primary aspects of the process.\nProcess models also describe and organize work and division of labor. They say something about what needs to be done when and by whom. This can be between collaborators, specialties, and consequently, the different tools and approaches applied in the process. Some pipeline models, like visualization or machine learning pipelines, describe technical systems, the flow of data and how this is processed once the system have been implemented (Moreland 2013). These can also be considered process models, because the individual components need to be developed and appropriated to the data and task at some point. A pipeline is also an object of design1.\nFinally, there are a class of process models that deal with the challenge of moving from an articulated need to a solutions through a series of activities that inform both the need and the solution (they all do). While Royces’ (1960) initial waterfall model describe a software engineering process, it also grapples with the inherent challenge of dealing with internal and external change in the process. When we start working on a problem, the work changes the articulation and nature of the problem as well as informing the solution (Dewey 1933, Popper 1966, Simon 1973, Rittel and Webber 1973, Schön 1983). While the models do not all take the iterative nature of the work into account, it is fundamental to the process 2 3. Design process models often put a strong emphasis on iteration, agile software engineering similarly, and a lot of the classical models also acknowledge the need for revisiting previous steps (e.g. Li et al. 2016). This is perhaps more about process thinking, sense-making, problem-solution formulation and dialectic reasoning, but this underscores any process.\nThe intent is to focus on relevance for human-data interaction, without venturing too far into specific topic areas or entire fields. I will include works that talk about ‘information’ (needs, seeking, behaviour) and knowledge discovery as well, as it plays a crucial role in motivating HDI and is a part of the outcome of the process – one want to be informed, know more about something than before and/or get a new perspective."

    "text": "A simple organizing model\nThe primary focus will be to describe a working model that allow us to identify and organize prior work and important problems for research and application. The model combine multiple models and I will do my best to pay attention to language and differences in the emphasis.\n\nInformation need\nThe process and model begin with an information need. What an information is or can be is an open question and pertains to the individual case. Hofstede et al. (1996) argue that it can be that of an organisation or individuals, which suggest that it is already articulated (which may be the case). It is also common that the information need comes from someone else, e.g. a client (find research on this) or someone else in the organization that needs to know something (find research on this). Regardless, an information need is often open and vague, and “a subjective experience that occurs only in the mind of the person in need and, consequently, is not directly accessible to an observer” (Wilson, 1997). Articulating the neeed is therefor inherently challenging and prone to “I don’t know what I’m looking for, but I’ll know when I find it” (Hofstede et al., 1996). This means that an information need can start with something puzzeling that needs to be informed before a concret question can be articulated: “A question well put is half answered” (Dewey, 1933). This is a dialectical process that involves taking initial steps into the process: “In fact, a number of the real world analysts we have interviewed strongly emphasized the fact that interation with the data leads to the formation of hypotheses.” (Brachman & Anand, 1994) And it is assumed that it is a social process and involves collaborative sensemaking (Paul & Reddy, 2010).\nThere are seveal things to consider here. First, the information need does not come out of the void. It comes from everyday experiences, and often when confronted with something that is puzzling and prompts further inquery. I speculate that when it comes to data-centric information needs, it can be triggered by being exposed to something that is already data-laden:\n\nWhen seeing ones electricity bill, one may wonder how the electricity price is determined or how much of the consumption is green energy?\nWhen experiencing delays in public transport, one may wonder how frequent such delays are or if there is a way to determine where the bus is currently?\nWhen discussing the climate crisis, one may question how much impact the individual have or what kind of habit changes make the biggest difference?\n\nIn the context of HDI, we assume that the user is somewhat motivated to find the information within a structure database or trusted source, and will not just be satisfied by searching the web. This is likely the case in a majority of instances, but we are only interested in supporting the transition from information need to interacting with data.\nSo, the first challenge and research theme in HDI interaction should be how people construct their information need – what is it they need to know? Why? and how does this develop and change througout the process? Is the final outcome an answer to the original information need or did it change?\nImportant readings here are both within philosophy on reasoning, problem formulation, dialectices etc. and traditional work within information sciences on information need and information seeking behaviour.\nI am not sure this is so relevant in understanding HDI, but for background stuff it might be.\n\n\nData discovery\nOnce some initial information need is articulated, the user will need to find some data that can inform this. In early work on knowledge discovery it was assumed that this involved consulting familiar data sources, e.g. a database within the organization or similar. For a subset of scenarios, this is also the case today, e.g. within business analysis, analytics, applied data science and modelling. However, with all the available data and the likelyhood that the information needer is not someone working close to a specific domain-specific database, this can easily involve trying to discover data that can inform the question.\nPeople within KDD talk about this step in the same way as they talk about wrangling.\nI think that this is more of an issue of identifying and establishing initial ideas about data platforms.\n\nconsensus data\nopen data\nworld et.c\n\n– search – assessment\n– Reddit study – Open data study\n\n\nData exploration\n\n\nData wrangling\n\n\nData analysis\n\n\nData products (outcomes)\n\nwhat\nrepresentation\napplication\nwhat are the key elements\nwhat are the vision\nwhat are the challenges\nwhat are the empirical studies\nwhat are the technical studies\nwhat are the key challenges\n\nCurrently, I am drawing on a basic step model that intends to describe the many places in common data analysis processes people may interact with data:"

It has been an exciting and incredible ride, but every time I have visited collaborators and folks outside the university walls, in the software industry, digitization projects, the public sector, and other initiatives, I have been struck with all the amazing projects, talented people, and exciting challenges. Now I would like to try out the challenge – how far can my skills and experience bring the projects I engage in and contribute to?\nIf this sounds interesting to you or your organization, then reach out. I would love to connect and have a chat about future possibilities.\n\nSoftware engineering and IT-projects\nConstructing better software that generates value for the client and users is important to me. It drives my teaching and some of my early research projects. The challenge of moving from client and user needs to a solution that provides the right user experience is fascinating to me. It is all about translating needs and early ideas into requirements, features, and user stories. This involves both design research and aligning client and stakeholder expectations in the process, and tailoring the (agile) development process to the task and expectations.\nI have experience with multiple EU projects, research projects, and collaborations with the public sector. I have worked with various methods for identifying requirements in close collaboration with clients, through design research and user-centered methods, and software engineering. I am currently running a course on Experimental Systems Development where students are thought how to identify needs and solutions, write scenarios, explore prototypes, write user-stories and go through an agile process. I have supervised over 100 student projects within this course, multiple thesis projects, and other design projects.\nWhen I have the opportunity to participate in IT projects, I bring my strong communication skills, a rich set of methods, a strong analytical mindset, and experience in software development and multi-stakeholder projects.\n\n\nUser-centered initiatives around data and data-driven projects\nBecoming data-driven has become a requirement. This involves combining existing and new data, with both strong technical analysis and knowledge from multiple domain experts. Identifying new use cases and valuable analyses for client and/or organizational data is a challenging task that involves an understanding of the technical infrastructure and how organizations work with data and information.\nIn this role, I have experience with multiple data-oriented projects and research involving domain-experts in analytics and co-designing novel applications. I have an interest in the role of visualization, how people interact with and make sense of data, and strategic approaches in identifying the right technical- and organizational (governance) model for becoming more data-driven.\nIn addition to my skills in facilitating co-design processes and exploring novel use cases for (open) data, I also find it engaging to develop data visualizations as means to understanding data (model-fitness-use) and identify important insights."

    "text": "I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Aarhus University, with human-data interaction as my research focus. I try to understand how to better integrate data into application design, interactive systems, analytics, visualization, and interaction design from an end-user perspective. I research how people use data and explore new tools to support analytics, visualization, and data-driven approaches. I teach experimental system development, design research, user-driven agile software development, user experience, co-design, and prototyping.\nThere are two trends that I find exciting: The increased availability of (open) data APIs and the increase in potential users – from specialists to practically everyone. You can download data on your electricity consumption with a few clicks – what we need is better tools and innovative services that integrate analytics and visualization for everyday decision-making.\nI have an MSc in Information Technology on Interaction Design, Open Data, and Smart City technologies. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Aarhus University in Human-Computer Interaction (Interaction Design, User Experience, User-centered design, and design research). My thesis focus on the theoretical and empirical foundations for location-based services and community software."
