# Project Constraints

## Content Ownership
- NEVER write blog posts or notes content for Henrik
- NEVER write project descriptions or personal content
- You may ONLY help with:
  - Planning and prioritizing content
  - Structuring outlines
  - Asking clarifying questions about ideas
  - Technical implementation (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Working Directory
- Planning work goes in `/planning` folder
- Use markdown files for plans, outlines, and documentation
- Keep planning files organized and dated when relevant

## Technology Stack
- Pure HTML5, CSS, vanilla JavaScript only
- NO build systems, NO frameworks, NO dependencies
- NO npm, NO bundlers, NO preprocessors
- External resources limited to:
  - Google Fonts
  - CDN-hosted fonts (cm-web-fonts)
- Keep it simple and maintainable

## File Organization
- HTML pages in root directory
- Styles in `/style`
- Media in `/media` (images, pdfs, data)
- JavaScript in `/js` (when needed for demos)
