    "text": "(note to self: I will add graphics to the post once I have implemented stuff)\nIn the last iteration of this post series on developing a Garmin transport notification application, we discussed scenarioes and started developing high-level requirements and a few diagram. I still do not know if this is right and there is a lot of things to figure out. And the best way of figuring something out, in my opinion and experience, is to prototype it.\nNow, I believe and teach that prototyping is not just a semi-random excursion into building something, but a strategic method driven by well-articulated problems that one needs to inform or identify solutions for. There is a lot of good papers on prototyping, I usually recommend Floyd’s paper on “A Systematic look at Prototyping” (Floyd, 1984) and perhaps Lim et al’s. paper on “The Anatomy of Prototypes” (Lim et al., 2008), although it is a bit more oriented towards physical design. I will spend a bit time on some of the points from Floyd, because I will use them to analyse the scenarios and context diagram of our Garmin transit notification app to identify oppertunities for prototyping parts of the system to figure out how to proceed and prioritize in the development process."

    "text": "Prototyping as a strategic method\nThe most important rule for prototyping is the economic principle of prototyping, which states that “the best prototype is one that, in the simplest and most efficient way, makes the possibilities and limitations of a design idea visible and measurable” (Lim et al., 2008, p. 3). Following this, we should carefully identify the features we need more information about and then how and in what format we can create a prototype that can inform us. This includes setting criteria for evaluation and success. People often miss the material dimension. We do not need elaborate tooling or interactive examples if we need to prototype the layout of a page. That can be done with pen and paper, and evaluated with someone who knows the task the system should support; If we need to figure out if a certain part of the sytem scales, we do not need a user interface. We can just set up a benchmark prototype to identify issues related to scale.\nThe second important rule is that prototypes should be discarded after the process is completed. Throw them out and keep the lessons learned – do not put protypes into production!\nFloyd outlines a few terms to be used when prototyping. First, the objective of the prototype. Here she defines three different objectives:\n\nExploratory: Prototypes as a way of exploring a problem-solution space through multiple iterations and alternatives\nExperimental: Prototypes as a way to test a critical component through formularing an experiment\nEvolutionary: An approach to prototyping where the prototype scales into final features etc.\n\nI like the two first, because they contain clear criteria for when the prototype is done and discarded. Only the insights are kept. I dislike the latter as it is often unintentionally happening and when prototypes become products we often miss important procedures for quality assurance (e.g. TDD) and `the big picture’ (e.g. software architecture design discussions).\nThe second set of terms Floyd outline are two different types of prototypes:\n\nHorizontal prototypes: Explore features without the deep implementation, e.g. interface, interaction, flow, protocol design, architecture\nVertical: Explore features in how they are implemented, e.g. from user input, over submit and validation, to backend persistence\n\nMy typical example is that you can have both a horizontal and vertical prototype for buying an airplane ticket. The horizontal prototype explores the user interfaces, service design, payment etc. without ever touching the backend system. The vertical prototype examines how the ticket is reserved in the system, registration, payment and confirmation etc.\nFinally, Floyd offer an stepwise approach to prototyping:\n\nFunctional selection: Identify the feature the prototype should explore or inform\nConstruction: Identify what needs to be constructed for the prototype to inform the design\nEvaluation: Identify the criteria on which the prototype should be evaluated (and when it is successful)\nFuture use: The role the prototype could play in the future of the system (early demo, training etc.)\n\nThe three first should be part of all prototyping processes. The last one should only be considered if there is a pressing need."

    "text": "Identifying prototypes\nThe next step in developing out Garmin Trafic notification app, is to identify some possible points where prototypes can help inform the design and features of the system. Before we do this, lets revisit the scenario and a few of the top-level requirements:\nThe user is getting ready in the morning. Their smartwatch notifies them that the bus for work is leaving in 15 minutes, so they have to walk in 5 minutes to catch it. They snoozes the notification. 4 minutes later the notification goes off again. The user decides that they is not ready yet, so they press next on the smart watch app. 10 minutes later, their Garmin smartwatch notifices them that the train is leaving in 15 minutes, so they have to walk in 5 minutes to catch it. The user accepts the notification and pack the last things in his back. 5 minutes later they leave for the train.\nFrom the scenario and design features identified in the last post, we can destill some neccesary user-stories:\n\nAs a user, I want to be able to select ‘next’ transportation option to postpone notifications until relevant.\nAs a user, I want to be able to ‘accept’ a transportation option to indicate that I have chosen to use that connection\nAs a user, I want to configure frequent destinations and a travel-window, so that I can get relevant notifications on public transit times and walking distance.\n\nThe two first user stories are derived directly from the scenario. Given that the device has a limited number of interaction options (touch / buttons), these can and should be prototyped as part of the sprint wherein the feature is implemented.\nHowever, the last user story is a bit more open. We do not know how to best support defining frequent locations and transporation windows or where. We do not know if doing it on the Garmin smartwatch is feasible, usable or provide the best user experience, compared to doing it in an accompanied smartphone application or in a browser. The activity itself happens outside the primary use of the system. Hence, we should do a couple of exploratory horisontal prototypes to test:\n\nWhich interaction technique is best suited for the user story: touch and buttons on smartwatch, configuration pane in the Garmin Connect page where the user installs the app to the smartwatch, or on a responsive website.\nWhat are the suited metaphors for defining frequent locations and in particular the travel-time window?\nAnd more technically, how are the user preferences persisted and transfered to the watch?\n\nThe last prototype might be a vertical experimental prototype as it deals with cross-component interaction.\nIf we turn our attention to C4 container diagram from the last post, we can use that to identify technical prototypes for the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\ncluster_6\n\n Garmin App [Software System]   \n\n1\n\n Henrik [Person] A user of the Garmin GTFS notification app   \n\n4\n\n Garmin Connect [Software System] Garmin smartphone application for distributing smartwatch applications   \n\n1->4\n\n  Install Garmin app on smartwatch.   \n\n8\n\n Webapplication [Container: JavaScript] A web application that helps the user define their preferences by providing IF-THIS-THEN-THAT rules for the garmin app.   \n\n1->8\n\n  Create IF-THIS-THEN-THAT rules   \n\n2\n\n RejsePlanen API [Software System] GTFS data API. Provides lines, stops, departuer and arrival times, connections etc.   \n\n3\n\n GIS Distance API [Software System] Provides distance and walking time estimates from user location to nearest departure point.   \n\n7\n\n Garmin Smartwatch app [Container: Monkey C SDK] The smartwatch application that is the primary on-the-go way of interacting with the system.   \n\n4->7\n\n  Transfers user configuration   \n\n7->1\n\n  Notifies user about next possible transit   \n\n7->3\n\n  Estimates walking time and distance   \n\n9\n\n  Database [Container: Garmin SDK DB API] Stores user preferences (time/destination)   \n\n7->9\n\n  Store user preferences   \n\n8->2\n\n  Get travel time info from API   \n\n8->4\n\n  Transfer user preferences to device  \n\n\nFigure 1: Container View Garmin GTFS Notification App.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, and connected to the user story and prototypes above, we need to figure out how to transfer and where to store user settings. Do we do it in the Garmin Connect app, on the smartphone or somewhere else.\nSecond, there we need to prototype the interaction with the RejsePlanen API to identify the best strategy (and where in the system) for querying and interacting with the GTSF data.\nBoth these could be horisontal exploratory prototypes testing various connections and query strategies and/or vertical prototypes exploring the best strategy for integrating the features into the different components.\nFinally, there are likely additional prototypes needed in the beginning of the development of the application. The developer (me) do not know the tooling or SDK for developing within the Garmin ecosystem, nor does he know Monkey-C. Here it would be beneficial to construct a few smaller prototypes as a vehicle for learning the technologies required. It is a good strategy to seperate these from the actual implementation to avoid noise related to design decisions for the system in the early stages."

    "text": "In this note I am trying to identify a useful design or process model for Human-Data Interaction. I am not going to claim that HDI need a process model that stand a part from all the others, rather I would argue that we need an integrative one given that HDI is defined as “the human manipulation, analysis and sense-making of data.” Elmqvist (2011). My own interest can be formulated as the challenge of asking good questions to data, or rather, supporting citizens in asking good questions to public data. This involves examining the genesis of the question (information need) and how this interacts with data and the answer, and the process in between. A process model is useful tool in many ways:\nBecause different disciplines are concerned with different stages and have identified specific challenges and solutions, a process model is a tool for identifying and organize particular challenges, prior work, useful techniques and representations across multiple perspectives. For instance, knowledge discovery concerns itself with the early part of the data analytics process (Fayyad et al. 1996), (visual) analytics with the middle part (Sacha et al. 2014) and information visualization with the presentation (McKenna et al. 2014). None of these areas ignore the other steps, but take particular interest in challenges and solutions for a few primary aspects of the process.\nProcess models also describe and organize work and division of labor. They say something about what needs to be done when and by whom. This can be between collaborators, specialties, and consequently, the different tools and approaches applied in the process. Some pipeline models, like visualization or machine learning pipelines, describe technical systems, the flow of data and how this is processed once the system have been implemented (Moreland 2013). These can also be considered process models, because the individual components need to be developed and appropriated to the data and task at some point. A pipeline is also an object of design1.\nFinally, there are a class of process models that deal with the challenge of moving from an articulated need to a solutions through a series of activities that inform both the need and the solution (they all do). While Royces’ (1960) initial waterfall model describe a software engineering process, it also grapples with the inherent challenge of dealing with internal and external change in the process. When we start working on a problem, the work changes the articulation and nature of the problem as well as informing the solution (Dewey 1933, Popper 1966, Simon 1973, Rittel and Webber 1973, Schön 1983). While the models do not all take the iterative nature of the work into account, it is fundamental to the process 2 3. Design process models often put a strong emphasis on iteration, agile software engineering similarly, and a lot of the classical models also acknowledge the need for revisiting previous steps (e.g. Li et al. 2016). This is perhaps more about process thinking, sense-making, problem-solution formulation and dialectic reasoning, but this underscores any process.\nThe intent is to focus on relevance for human-data interaction, without venturing too far into specific topic areas or entire fields. I will include works that talk about ‘information’ (needs, seeking, behaviour) and knowledge discovery as well, as it plays a crucial role in motivating HDI and is a part of the outcome of the process – one want to be informed, know more about something than before and/or get a new perspective."

    "text": "A simple organizing model\nThe primary focus will be to describe a working model that allow us to identify and organize prior work and important problems for research and application. The model combine multiple models and I will do my best to pay attention to language and differences in the emphasis.\n\nInformation need\nThe process and model begin with an information need. What an information is or can be is an open question and pertains to the individual case. @hofstede1996query argue that it can be that of an organisation or individuals, which suggest that it is already articulated (which may be the case). It is also common that the information need comes from someone else, e.g. a client (find research on this) or someone else in the organization that needs to know something (find research on this). Regardless, an information need is often open and vague, and “a subjective experience that occurs only in the mind of the person in need and, consequently, is not directly accessible to an observer” [@wilson1997information]. Articulating the neeed is therefor inherently challenging and prone to “I don’t know what I’m looking for, but I’ll know when I find it” [@hofstede1996query]. This means that an information need can start with something puzzeling that needs to be informed before a concret question can be articulated: “A question well put is half answered” [@dewey1933]. This is a dialectical process that involves taking initial steps into the process: “In fact, a number of the real world analysts we have interviewed strongly emphasized the fact that interation with the data leads to the formation of hypotheses.” [@brachman1994process] And it is assumed that it is a social process and involves collaborative sensemaking [@paul2010understanding].\nThere are seveal things to consider here. First, the information need does not come out of the void. It comes from everyday experiences, and often when confronted with something that is puzzling and prompts further inquery. I speculate that when it comes to data-centric information needs, it can be triggered by being exposed to something that is already data-laden:\n\nWhen seeing ones electricity bill, one may wonder how the electricity price is determined or how much of the consumption is green energy?\nWhen experiencing delays in public transport, one may wonder how frequent such delays are or if there is a way to determine where the bus is currently?\nWhen discussing the climate crisis, one may question how much impact the individual have or what kind of habit changes make the biggest difference?\n\nIn the context of HDI, we assume that the user is somewhat motivated to find the information within a structure database or trusted source, and will not just be satisfied by searching the web. This is likely the case in a majority of instances, but we are only interested in supporting the transition from information need to interacting with data.\nSo, the first challenge and research theme in HDI interaction should be how people construct their information need – what is it they need to know? Why? and how does this develop and change througout the process? Is the final outcome an answer to the original information need or did it change?\nImportant readings here are both within philosophy on reasoning, problem formulation, dialectices etc. and traditional work within information sciences on information need and information seeking behaviour.\nI am not sure this is so relevant in understanding HDI, but for background stuff it might be.\n\n\nData discovery\nOnce some initial information need is articulated, the user will need to find some data that can inform this. In early work on knowledge discovery it was assumed that this involved consulting familiar data sources, e.g. a database within the organization or similar. For a subset of scenarios, this is also the case today, e.g. within business analysis, analytics, applied data science and modelling. However, with all the available data and the likelyhood that the information needer is not someone working close to a specific domain-specific database, this can easily involve trying to discover data that can inform the question.\nPeople within KDD talk about this step in the same way as they talk about wrangling.\nI think that this is more of an issue of identifying and establishing initial ideas about data platforms.\n\nconsensus data\nopen data\nworld et.c\n\n– search – assessment\n– Reddit study – Open data study\n\n\nData exploration\n\n\nData wrangling\n\n\nData analysis\n\n\nData products (outcomes)\n\nwhat\nrepresentation\napplication\nwhat are the key elements\nwhat are the vision\nwhat are the challenges\nwhat are the empirical studies\nwhat are the technical studies\nwhat are the key challenges\n\nCurrently, I am drawing on a basic step model that intends to describe the many places in common data analysis processes people may interact with data:"

    "text": "Status: Rough draft!\nTwo key trends offer an extraoridinary oppertunity for thinking about strategies for changing or helping people change their electricity consumption habits. First, the energy-crises means that prices are increasing and will fluctuate more often due to supply and demand. Second, the climate-crisis mean that more and more people share an interest in changing their ecological footprint and change their consumption behaviour1. That means that there are a lot of people who want to participate in understanding and changing their consumption habits – some motivated by economy and some by a moral standpoint.\nAt the same time, energy producers, grid companies and energy providers are investing billions into Smart grid solutions – using digitization, modelling, prediction etc. to make the best out of the current grid infrastructure in order to supply and increased demand. There are two key challenges: Dirst, switching to green energy mean changes in the supply side – energy when the wind is blowing and sun is shining – that does not always fit demand. Second, challenges on the demand side. Just like traffic there are peak consumption, in particular from households. We use power when we get up in the morning and when we come home and cook dinner. This consumption pattern is not as flexible as we imagine – kids go to school at the same time and most families have to cook between 17 - 19. Generally speaking, out habits are collective. And it might worsen when everyone switches to electrical cars – what happens when everyone return home and plug in their EV at the same time? Peak is gonna happen. And peak is bad – the energy need surges and the infrastructure is struggling to meet the demands at the neccesary throughput."

The smartgrid efforts will likely optimize our infrastructure as best as possible (save Jevons Paradox and Khazzoom-Brookes postulate2). Still, there are lot of strategies to visit and revisit on the consumer side, in particular for households (to address the peak-problem) and small and medium sized business (SMVs).\nGiven the number of consumers interested in contributing, I think a user-centered approach should supplement the producer- and grid-centered (system-centered) approach. And to develop successful intervention, we need to consider it as a partnership with empasis on dialogue and mutual learning. This points to participatory and co-design approches. But before we go into that, we need to examine the existing strategies."

    "text": "Understanding different strategies\n\n\n\nSketch: Strategies for changing consumption behaviour\n\n\nIn the figure above, I have tried to sketch a intervention space and plot in different strategies. There are five strategies3. Each strategy have a role to play, but operates with different assumptions and effects. I have split the space into a producer- and consumer side; and user-centered and system-centered approches.\n\nNothing (or optimizing the Smart Grid)\nThe first one is the current dominant strategy in terms of research, development and investment. The consumers will consume, while the producers and grid operators invest deeply into optimizing the infrastructure and production to meet changing demands.\nThe orientation toward the consumer, is as a consumer, and the efforts to understand consumption behaviour is approached from the perspective of understanding the consumption in the grid and modelling consumer behaviour as group behaviour (cittion needed). As said, this is a very important effort, but it will not provide the gains needed without other efforts.\n\n\nRegulating consumption through pricing\nAnother common and current strategy is to regulate energy-consumption is through dynamic pricing. As the energy market changes, so does the consumer pricing. A more recent initiative in Denmark, is to increase the price between 17 and 20, in hopes that this will motivate consumers to move their flexible consumption to another hour (citation needed). This is clearly to address the peak-problem.\nThe is an effective strategy, because we know that economic incentives work (citation needed). However, while this strategy likely impacts all consumers, it will affect low-income groups more (citation needed). And since only a marginal part of the consumption (laundry) is flexible, it is hard to move a significant amount of consumption, unless skipping hot meals and turning of the refrigerator.\n\n\nNudging consumers\nThe pricing model described above will incentify consumers to change some of their behaviour. A popular term for this is to ‘nudge’ consumers. That is to use means to manipulate consumers into changing their behaviour. I have seperated this strategy from the above, because pricing is unavoidable, whereas nudging is a strategy that can be initiated in addition. Nudging can come in the form of reminders, competition, awards etc. geared toward promoting specific behaviours. It is different from education and information-driven intiatives, because the consumer does not neccesarily need to know or link the aspects of the nudging-campain with the intended behaviour change.\nFrom the figure, we can notice that the nudging strategy have moved from the producer side to the consumer side. Whereas pricing is set at the producer side, nudging initiatives are most powerful within the context where the behaviour-change need to happen.\nResearch on nudging and energy https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300383\n\n\nInformation\nOn the user-centered side we have strategies that focus on providing target information and advice for consumers.\nParagraf 14\n\n\nConsultancy"

    "text": "Status: Rough draft!\nI am trying to understand and explore aspects of the peak-demand problem, in particular within the electricity grid from a household perspective. Peak-demand is when there is the highest amount of demand on the electricity system. This is typically when a large amount of consumers need energy at the same time. One famous example is the TV-surge in the UK, where there is a significant increase in demand created by people putting over a kettle as TV-shows end. The peak-demand problem introduces two1 related problems, that go into effect depending on local conditions. So, with this reference, I have tried to sketch peak versus non-peak below.\nFirst, peak-demand create a need for increasing production of energy. In traditional systems, the increase in demand might be anticipated and production can be increased. In systems that are based on unstable sources of energy (wind, sun, water), this can become a problem where auxiliary production is needed (peak power stations). Second, peak-demand introduces an increased load on the grid – for both transimission and local distribution. This increases the strain on the grid and transformer stations, and the local grid. While the kettle might introduce a significant increase already, I assume the problem will worsen if everyone come home and plug in an Electrical Vehicle (EV) at the same time (and we do not have an intelligent response in the grid and household). EVs draw significantly more power than kettles.\nI do not yet know if the peak demand problem is mostly challenging production or distribution. This likely depend on the local infrastructure, energy sources and demand patterns."

I have not considered increasing the capacity of the grid or production, as this makes little sense strategically (see Jevons Paradox and Khazzoom-Brookes postulate2)).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Peak options: a. Peak; b. Remove peak consumption; c. Move peak consumption; d. Stretch or soften peak (flatten the curve!)\n\n\nWe have three options:\n\nRemove peak consumption: Construct some intervention that remove the peak consumption. If I stop cooking my meals and just eat a sandwhich for dinner, then I’ve removed some consumption.\nMove peak consumption: Move the consumption to another time. If I start eathing dinner outside peak-hours, e.g. at 21, I have effectively removed (my consumption) from peak.\nDistribute consumption: Consider interventions that distributes the local consumption to flatten peak. This could be cooking earlier and then just reheat at dinner time.\n\nNow, there are two considerations here. First, the peak I showed above is my peak consumption. That is only important if it coincide with peak consumption in the part of the grid I’m part of (see figure 1). Second, and implied, moving can then either be considered a question of chaging my behaviour entirely or being flexible on a collective level. That is, I get to keep my peak consumption, I just have to move it."

I hypothesise that both individual (household) behaviour change and collective (neigborhood) efforts will be effective. One common strategy is to use monitary incentives to change people’s behaviour.

Sometimes there are requirements, to begin with, but they are often defined as high-level specifications, and often technical. The important details of the functions and features as they are presented to and used by future users are typically vaguely defined and negotiable. In this specification, they are also underinformed in terms of what the future users need and want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIxD Experiment with coordinated views and GTFS data\n\n\n\nHenrik Korsgaard April, 2023\n\n\n\nIn this short note, I explore a interaction design technique for creating coordinated views between a map visualisation (of a GTFS bus route) and a simple slider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarmin Public Transit Notification App I\n\n\n\nHenrik Korsgaard February, 2023\n\n\n\nIn this note I begin designing a Garmin Smartwatch application that can notify me when I need to start walking towards the bus to make it home within a predefined time window. In this first part, I take a scenario-based design approach and move from a few scenarios to identifying high-level design features and technical components using C4 diagrams.\n\n\nIt is the first part of a series where I try to move from idea and a simple use-case scenario to a full application using the steps I teach others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Rhythms in Electricity Consumption?\n\n\n\nHenrik Korsgaard December, 2022\n\n\n\nI’m trying to find out how to analyse and visualize electricity consumption.

Firstly, the long-running conversation in HCI about its ‘status’ as a field and its constitution. And secondly, the overall feeling of what it’s like being ‘kicked around’ by technology, which we sensed much of HCI have experienced for a long time. The conversation is depicted here as a series of turns between Henrik and Stuart but this is mainly for the purposes of presentation. In reality, Henrik initiated some notes, and Stuart then provided further commentary on the notes."

    "text": "Background\nIn 2017, I was in Barcelona to conduct interviews with people involved in a civic data collection and visualisation project. This was during the Catalan independece referendum vote in October 2017. At that point the city was full of signs and posters encouraging either “Vota Si” or “Vota No”. The first night I was startled by loud metallic banging at 22.00 in the city. I soon learned that the people of Barcelona bang their pots and pans outside in support for the referendum.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days later I ended up interviewing a designer and media artist named Josecarlos Florez on his participation in the data project. He participated in the project because he was fascinated by data and how it can be used to influence local political issues. After the interview he started talking about an idea he had for an upcoming installation involving people’s conversation on the referendum on social media. He asked if I knew how to mine Twitter data. I do and I liked the idea and started working on it as soon as I came back to my hotel."

Then he wanted to record the timestamps of the tweets and store the timing. This would then be used to play back the tweets on pots and pans, while a display would show the tweets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHastags associated with yes voters\nHastags associated with no voters\n\n\n\n\n#Votarem\n#NoVotarem\n\n\n#ReferendumCatalan\n#NoVotareis\n\n\n#CatalanReferendum\n#EspanaSeLevanta\n\n\n#Independencia\n#EspanaSaleALaCalle\n\n\n#CatalunaLibre\n#EspanaUnida\n\n\n#1oct\n#CatalunaEsEspana\n\n\n#1o\n#Referendumilegal\n\n\n\n#EspanaNoSeRompe\n\n\n\n#Unidad\n\n\n\nI set up a simple data mining script in preperation for October 1st and captured the data. I used NodeJS to mine the data using the Twitter API and the keywords above. I stored each tweet in a MongoDB and checked for dublicates, e.g. retweets without any comments etc. In order to allow Josecarlos to replay the data, I created a small websocket server, also using NodeJS, and create an entry-point on my website. This allowed him to connect his Arduino setup and replay the data in his installation.\nJosecarlos made the brilliant setup in the video above to replay the data on pots using an Arduino and home-made drum-like actuators. The tweets are replayed on the laptop as well."

    "text": "We can learn a lot, it turns out. In this research project, I developed a series of visualizations of document revisions to support qualitative interviews and analysis related to collaborative writing, approches, division of labour and contributions to a shared text.\nWe interviewed multiple groups of people writing together and got access to their shared document. From there, we downloaded the revisions and analyzed them using tools (scripts) developed for the task.\nThe main focus of the visualizations was to identify where in the document authors worked and when in relation to the work of their co-authors. We hypothesized that authors divided the writing into tasks centered around particular sections in the document, e.g. being responsible for a specific section. What we call “territories” in the research publication.\nTo inform this hypotheses and identify territories and collaborative writing patterns (hand-over, edits etc.), we analyzed Google Document text revisions. These consist of one insert or remove operation with n characters. Google Document text operations are chronological, so the main challenge is to analyse the revisions in terms of where they are in the document."

These correlate with the themes from the qualitative interviews, see Larsen-Ledet & Korsgaard (2019). Figure Figure 1 show how to read the visualizations. Each line in the visualizations corresponds to a paragraph in the text and the order the spatial/indexical order of the edits. For some paragraphs, we only see a few blocks, e.g. one for a copy-paste, whereas for other we see significantly more edits (both characters currently in the paragraph and deleted character).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: How to read the visualizations. Each line in the visualization corresponds to a paragraph in the shared document.\n\n\nFirst, we observed the territories hypothesized in the research. Figure Figure 2 show how several authors (blue, yellow and green) work in different parts of a larger document, with few edits in the blocks of the co-authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A visual example of author territories.\n\n\nSecond, we observed that collaborative writing often means people divide the sections and do the bulk of the writing in their part of the document. When writing in other people’s paragraphs, the visualization show that this is typically smaller edits (typos, wording etc.) and/or transitions between different paragraphs. Figure Figure 3 illustrate this with a lot of small fragmented edits and transition edits in the beginning or end of the paragraph (see e.g. the second line in figure Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A a visual example with a fragmented edit history.\n\n\nThird, the visualizations helped us to identify the temporal patterns of collaborative writing. Figure Figure 4 show how two collaborators – author A and author B – write together. A started writing, then added a few bits here and there, and then B take over and adds text in the middle and end of the paragraph (and then later C – green joins and add text in the beginning).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Temporal analysis examining turn-taking in document revisions."

    "text": "(The Danish title of the application and project was “Skal Jeg Køre Nu?”)\nThe road systems and traffic infrastructure is highly instrumented with devices to capture data on flow, incidents, congestion etc. These data are used by the planning departments and vendors to develop their strategy and measure and respond to changes in traffic patterns. In this project, we wanted to investigate a use-case for some of this data as open data: How could we develop an application that could support citizens in their daily lives based on open data? or more specifically how could citizens interact more or less directly with urban data?.\nThe answer was an application where users could query live traffic data and receive driving recommendations based on congestion and flow data. The screenshots above illustrate the flow of the application: First, (Figure 1 (a)), the user selects a predefined destination, e.g. work, and then queries the service by pressing the “Should I Drive Now?” button. Then (Figure 1 (b) and Figure 1 (c)) the service would calculate the commute time between the current location and chose destination based on real-time traffic data. Then it compares the current commute time with a precalculated ideal (normal traffic flow). If the delta was acceptable, the recommendation would be “yes”. If the route is congested, the application would recommend “maybe”, with some detailed information on specific hotspots and a recommendation on “perhaps wait 15 minutes to depart”. If there is a gridlock, the application would recommend similar to “maybe”, but add a recommendation to change commute patterns for subsequent days, e.g. “if you can schedule your drive early next time, then you can avoid congestion”.\nAs an additional feature (and to provide an explanation), users could also see a map with hotspots on the current traffic situation (Figure 1 (d))"

(a) Me lecturing, (b) Screen with delegated navigation and interaction, (c) Screen with discussion slide and comment field.\nIn my PhD I explored various ways to design for places and co-located interaction. One of the systems we developed was a co-located lecturing system that distributed the lecture slides and interaction widgets to client devices using the local network access point as a signer for location-based content. The core idea was to make the traditional university lecture an interactive object that could facilitate richer interactions between the participants in the lecture. We worked from the following scenario:\n“A lecturer enters the classroom and open their computer. They sign into the InPlenary application and navigate to today’s lecture slides. When activated, the projector in the room automatically1 shows the lecture. The lecturer can see a small view of their slides on their screen, their notes and a preview of the next slide. […] The students open their computers and login to InPlenary. They can see a preview of the current lecture in the room (which is also on the projector) and open it. When opened they can see a small view with the current slide and a note-taking widget where they can make notes. As the lecturer navigates through the slides, they also change on the student’s computers.”\nTo support the above scenario (and the idea of interactive widgets), we developed a slide authoring module that would ingest a pdf slideshow and transform it to an interactive lecture. In the authoring tool, the lecturer could add notes and interactive widgets to each slide. We also developed a system for coupling the lecturer and student computers to a specific room, and a module for running and distributing the slides to the client machines."

    "text": "Background: Designing for place and common interactive objects\nThe system explored several of the questions in my PhD thesis, in particular how to design interactive systems and applications for places? The short idea was to explore how we can design systems for particular places2 that serve multiple functions and multiple user demographies (e.g. libraries, community centres, educational institutions, urban spaces). InPlenary combines ideals from ubiquitous computing and ideas about common information spaces from CSCW.\nWhen designing for a place, we need to consider two requirements. First, the inhabitants (the students) bring their own devices into the space. We need to support multiple different devices and cross-device interaction. To address this we decided to implement the system as a web-application. Second, we need a way to establish location. In this case we utalized the existing network infrastructure to establish a connection between the devices and the room.\nIn the system, each classroom access point (AP) is assigned an unique key that is exposed through a small webserver running on the AP. When participants use the network, background services can query the AP for the key and send that along to the lecture system backend. This would match the user with a classroom, and when the lecture starts, a collection of slides (see figure Figure 2).\nClients would listen to slide changes and update the slides on each client device. With a personalized loging, students can write notes for each slide, answer interactive quizzes and provide feedback for classroom assignments etc. These would be persisted with the slides, so that the information is available when students review the lecture material later."

The background was developed in collaboration with people from the citizen service department at the municipality of Aarhus and participants in a two-day workshop hosted by Smart Aarhus. I developed the initial idea and concept together with Martin Brynskov, and was technical lead on developing the service platform."

The installation was part of the Media Architecture Biennale 2012 hosted in Aarhus. The installation on the city hall tower consisted of 5500 LEDs. We used these to show an animated data visualization of incoming and outgoing communication via the municipal “Postliste” data. Whenever a citizen makes an inquiry to the municipality, they have to reply in a timely manner. With the visualization of the response rate for individual requests, the media facade shows how some citizen requests are handled timely (blue dots), whereas others are delayed beyond the set reply rate (red dots).\nThe project was part of a broader effort in my work at Smart Aarhus on open data and my research and work within Urban Interaction design. The installation was accompanied by a platform where citizens of Aarhus could report issues or what we called “Urban Bugs”."

In my commute, I have a few combinations of options and connections depending on the time of day. On top of that, the schedule tend to change frequent enough for me to lose a sense of when the bus or train runs in relation to the next connection etc.\nI figured that I could build a small app to help me leave my office or home in time to catch the right connection at the right time.\nThis post is the first one in a series. I hope to go through some of the stages I recommend to my students when they develop application as part of their project in the course on Experimental Systems Development course at Aarhus University. Typically, we send the students out to do design ethnography[1] or contextual inquiry to identify relevant challenges to work on. In this example I’m designing something for myself, so we can skip that step. In this post I will work my way downwards from scenarios to identifying high-level requirements and modules.

Secondly, we will generate a couple of future scenarios. These scenarios will help us anchor the design in the present and address concrete needs, and explore future solutions that allow us identify and make early decisions on design features, technologies, critical prototypes and bootstrapping user-stories.\nHenrik (that’s me) is a 40-some white male who work as a researcher at a Computer Science department in the city. He lives in suberbia outside the city with his family. Every morning, Henrik get up around 6, do a short run, and then shower and eats. He helps his family get ready and some days he walks the dog. He usually leave for work between 8 and 9 in the morning (except when he is teaching early) and leaves for home around 16. He wants to commute more often, as a flexible option and to lower his CO2 footprint. However, planning the commute and experiences with frequent delays and lost connections make him chose the comforts of his car over public transport.\nThat gives us a bit of information on the context, the user and the challenge. Here are two future scenarios:\nHenrik is getting ready in the morning. His smartwatch notifies him that the bus for work is leaving in 15 minutes, so he has to walk in 5 minutes to catch it. He snoozes the notification. 4 minutes later the notification goes off again. Henrik decides that he is not ready yet, so he press next on the smart watch app. 10 minutes later, his Garmin smartwatch notifices him that the train is leaving in 15 minutes, so he has to walk in 5 minutes to catch it. He accepts the notification and pack the last things in his back. 5 minutes later he leaves for the train.\nHenrik is at work. He promised his familty that he would be home by 17. Around 16 his watch notifies him that a train is leaving in 20 minutes, so he has to walk in 5 minutes to catch it. He presses `next’ and the watch shows that a bus is leaving in 30 minutes. He presses ‘accept’ on his smartwatch. 10 minutes later the smartwatch reminds him that he needs to walk within 5 minutes to catch the bus. On the way to the bus, the watch notifies him that the bus is 5 minutes delayed.\nThese scenarios allow us to discuss and think about the design before we make too many decisions about the solution. Scenarios are excellent for early internal and external feedback. We can discuss them in our design team, with users, clients, developers and other stakeholders. We can invite users into the process and ask them to inform or co-write scenarios. Scenarios can be acted out and explored through embodied and contextual design methods, and we can develop scenarios as sketches, story-boards and even short movies to help illustrate the future use. If future users recognize their situation in the current scenario and agree that the future scenario is a compelling solution, then we have a good stakeholder alignment and can proceed."

    "text": "A bit of early software architecture\nThe requirement list above is not complete and a bit abstract. And the list format is not telling about the relationship between the design features of the application. We need a bit more detail before we can start writing code. While UX folks might start developing user journeys or interface sketches, or even better user stories, we need to do some high-level sketching of the software architecture to figure out the building blocks of our application, where the user interacts with the system, critical parts that needs to be prototyped and figured out etc. All this would happen anyways as a consequence of the obvious user story “the user wants to define frequently used transit routes based on location and time of day”. And likely, a lot of this will happen either in parallel with close coordination or in a series of design meetings in the release planning part of the agile process[2].\nWhen sketching high-level architecture, I’ve started using the C4 Model approach as a way to visualise the relationship between requirements, application design and software architecture3. For this application, it makes sense to sketch out the context and container level because the application draw on a couple of external services.\nSketching out the context includes the people (actors, roles, personas etc.) and the software systems that build up the application and and the context. This include additional systems the users and future system interacts with.The container diagram are the neccesary building blocks that provides the services that the system would offer. This level focus on high-level technologies and seperated deployable units such as a service, database, web-application etc. Containers can then be further decomposed into a component (modules) design for each container and subsequently into the familiar code-level diagrams from the UML family4\nThe diagrams can move from sketches (that is how I use them right now) to documentation that reflects how the actual system work. While some of the diagrams do show stuff that a sequence diagram would also capture once we know how everything will work, context and container diagrams provide a better way of sketching rough ideas and what we currently know about the application than traditional UML (in my opinion).\n\nContext diagram\nThe context diagram allow us to focus on the user and application, and the other systems that they interact with as part of the use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n1\n\n Henrik [Person] A user of the Garmin GTFS notification app   \n\n4\n\n Garmin Connect [Software System] Garmin smartphone application for distributing smartwatch applications   \n\n1->4\n\n  Install Garmin app on smartwatch.   \n\n6\n\n Garmin App [Software System] Provides personalized public transit notifications.

A bit of research reveal that Garmin use their Connect IQ application (for Android and iOS) to distribute smartwatch applications. When installed on the watch, the Connect IQ shows the application on your smartphone and provide ways of configuring the application. This way, the user avoid having to do the personalization on a small device like a smartwatch and can leverage the larger display, better input and network connection of their smartphone.\nThe requirements also tell us that we need some external services. One for getting all the information on public transit and one for estimating time and distance from the user location to the nearest stop. We can get the public transit data from the Danish provider of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data RejsePlanen. For walking time and distance estimation, we can use on of several distance API providers:\n\nGoogle Distance API\nGraphhopper API\nOpenRouteservice API\nOther OSM based services\n\nWhich one will likely be determined depending on pricing and developer usability, i.e. how easy it is to integrate the API.\n\n\nContainer diagram\nContainer diagrams show the different independent units (e.g. a separate processes) that executes code or stores data5.

    "text": "Status: Early draft\nI am interested in how to support people in interacting with data. Millions do it already, from querying databases, doing complext analysis in computational notebooks, working with data in spreadsheets, and interacting with information visualisations to understand a phenomena or relations through data. But in the age of the data deluge, the tools have a hard time keeping up and cognitive overload is an ever present challenge. I think we can create better tools for interacting with data, and I think there are some strong ideas from human-computer interaction and interaction design that can guide us.\nIn this post I explore the merits of thinking about the tools we use to interact with data as an instrument, based on ideas from instrumental interaction (Beaudouin-Lafon, 2000) and activity theory (Kaptelinin, 1996). As tool builders, this perspective allow us to examine the tools and how we use them, as well as exploring how we can improve the tool with a focus on what the tool can do, the goal and quality of interaction. Building better tools for interacting with data would also make the vast amounts of available data accessible to a larger audience and groups1.\nIn instrumental interaction, interface elements (e.g. a colorpicker, a scrollbar, cropping tool, text-highligthing) are tools that we use to manipulate domain objects (data, documents, images etc.) through interaction. This view is from activity theory, where use is conceptalized as a subject using an instrument on a object towards realizing a goal. This could be someone using a SQL editor to query a library database with the goal of getting information on e.g most popular books based on loan data; it could be someone using a visualization library or diagrams in Excel to create a visualization; or it could be someone exploring their energy consumption through an information visualization. In all cases, instrumental interaction offer a framing for analyzing the tool within the context of an activity for the purpose of improving the tool."

    "section": "SQL and instrumental interaction with data",
    "text": "SQL and instrumental interaction with data\nOne of the most common and fundamental ways to interact with data, is through using the Structured Query Language (SQL). Together with the relationel database, it was developed to help “the non-professional user into effective communication with a formatted database” (Chamberlin & Boyce, 1974, p. 250) and “to put end users into direct touch with the information stored in computers” (Codd, 2007, p. 109). SQL was considered an ideal way for non-programmers to access and query data. It was developed with an onset in English (Structured English Query Language – SEQUEL) and a declarative approach to data querying. SQL turned out to be hugely succesful (Helland, 2016) and is one of the commonly used technologies today. However, the idea that the casual user would use SQL to interact with databases on a frequent basis have not come true (yet). I’m not saying that SQL is the ideal tool for casual users, but if we could improve the tool to cater more to causal and non-technical users (e.g. designers, journalists, citizens), we can make the vast amount of data in SQL databases accessible to a significant larger audience2.\n\nSQL as a tool\n\n\nInteraction 1: SQL shell connected to a publication database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the interactive example above, you can use SQL as an instrument3 for interacting with the database. Try it – click on the terminal above and start typing. You can also click on the SQL code fields below and see the result.\nSELECT * FROM publications LIMIT 5;\nWhen we have to interact with an unfamiliar and undocumented database (like this one), we try to use the instrument to poke around to explore and discover how the data is organized and how to query for the information we need. This often involves multiple steps of trail-and-error to identify appropriate tables, their fields, relations and data:\nSELECT name FROM sqlite_master;\nSELECT * FROM authors LIMIT 5;\nSELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE name='authors';\nAnd you can do more complex stuff like querying multiple tables for specific results:\nSELECT publications.title, authors.first, authors.last, publications.year FROM publications INNER JOIN authorship ON publications.wid=authorship.wid INNER JOIN authors ON authorship.aid=authors.aid WHERE authors.last='Dewey';"

    "section": "Improving our tool",
    "text": "Improving our tool\nThat is neat, but there are a couple of problems and/or improvements we can introduce to make the tool more usable. The first one is with the structure and syntax of the query itself. For experience users that are familiar with the data model they are interacting with, it is trivial to write SELECT title FROM publications;. They know that there is a table called publications and that it contains a column with title. But for novice SQL users or experience users interacting with a new database, the SELECT first approach does not help us before we know where we select FROM (using SELECT * as a probing strategy can help). There are a couple of interaction design ideas we can apply to solve this issue. First, for novice users, we can add something as simple as autocomplet. We know the abstract syntax three for SQL, so it is trival to provide users with hints to both keywords and errors. Let’s try that.\n//DEMO\nThere is another small problem. Early research on the usability of different query languages by Reisner (1981), show that some users perform poorly due to the design choice of starting queries with SELECT instead of allowing FROM first as well4. Begining with SELECT or FROM represent two fundamental query writing strategies. The former is the translation strategy where the user is invited to look for approprate terms and search through trial and error (or find the data model described elsewhere). The latter is the operations-on-tables where the users indicate where they want to search before they search (operate). The operations-on-tables strategy is closer to the idea of instrumental interaction, than the translation strategy which focus more on semantic understanding. So it seems silly that we we require the users to remember what they want to select before they know where from. Let’s just address the issue by improving out tool so that valid SQL queries can start with FROM as well. We change two things about the tool. We make FROM a valid starting operation and when the query is done swap the two components FROM and SELECT behind the curtains5. Let us see that in action.\n//DEMO\nThere is another significant improvent we can make that combine the autocomplete and utalize allowing queries to start with FROM. In many cases we know something about what the user can query. We likely have a finite number of tables that can go into our autocomplete feature, and once the user have shown intent with FROM we can also suggest columns. Putting FROM in front make the autocomplete flow easier to implement, because we can narrow the suggestions based on the table selection and not the column selection.\n//DEMO"

    "text": "Summary: Playing language games\nConsidering SQL as an instrument for interacting with data allow us to consider multiple ways we can improve the tool without ever having to change the domain object, the database. Doing so could potentially allow us to make SQL accessible to more casual non-technical users and thereby make a vast amount of data accessible as well.\nWhile we are fiddling with the SQL language, why not introduce localization? If our future users are casual users and we do not expect them to write SQL without help, why do we expect them to use English? I know that SQL is derived from Structured English Query Language (SEQUEL), but when people use it across the globe and within a broad range of domains, I don’t see why we cannot offer localization or customized queries to increase accessiblity and semantic intuition. And when the database, table and column names are already in local languages, why force people to mix and match when they try to translate their question to a query (the query formulation problem, cf Hofstede et al. (1996))? If Danish journalists think “hent en liste over alle folketingets medlemmer, der stemte for lovforslag L87” (fetch me a list of all the members of parliament who voted for bill L87), why not make HENT synonymous with SELECT? That would be trivial.\nSimilarly, and with more recent research into both Large Language Models and Natual Language Interfaces for Databases (Affolter et al., 2019), our tool could be improved with both domain specific language features and/or a database specific LLM that supported queries based on natural language6.\nThere are other improvements to consider as well. Combining writing queries with other types of feedback, e.g. tabular views as demonstrated by The Gamma, visualizations and tabular views to support more complex quries like joins and group by. This is something I will investigate in a later post.\nFinally, when we ‘detach’ SQL from the database through the idea of SQL as an instrument, we can also explore multimodal interaction where our SQL tool can be used to interact with other data sources (APIs, tables, structure data etc.) and we can develop other tools that can interact with our database as well. This multi-multi scenario where users can use familiar tools with unfamilar data or people can collaborate without being forced to use the same tool (tool asymetry) is key in supporting collaboration across disciplines, e.g. in open data project (see Choi & Tausczik, 2017)."

    "text": "Skills and experiences\n\nDesign, research and evaluation\nI am an expert in interaction design and user experience, and how these two perspectives integrate with software development. I am an experienced qualitative and design researcher across multiple domains from home settings, over education and work, to communities and urban computing. I have facilitated multiple user-centered design processes involving domain studies, workshop facilitation, design meetings and requirement identification and development. I have played a leading role in multiple design projects and used various design formats for stakeholder engagement and alignment. I am familiar with and have applied multiple approches to usability and user experience design evaluation, including various walkthrough methods, heuristic evaluation, focus groups, experience sampling, think aloud, scenario-based evaluation etc. I have experience in teaching interaction design, user experience, evaluation and qualitative approches to design research.\n\n\nSoftware engineering\nI have a broad set of skills in design and software engineering. I developed multiple research prototypes, applications, data-driven projects, etc. applying my interaction design and software developer skills. I have developed smartphone applications from conceptual design to deployment, smaller modules, proof-of-concept systems, network-based systems, data visualisations, and much more, in a broad range of languages. I am familiar with Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development, SCRUM, agile and a large host of devlopment models and principles. I have come to learn that programming languages matter less than a clear vision, well-written requirements and user stories, and the overarching system design (from high-level architecture to specific modules). I have more experience with web-based technologies but have also developed more low-level components, data APIs, and traditional applications. I have experience in teaching practical software development in a project-based course that moves from user needs and requirement identification, to a 3 spring agile process and final evaluation.\n\n\nProject management\nI have project management experience from various research and public-private projects, as well as conference organizing events and technical projects. This includes managing deliverables, preparation of technical documentation, developing procedures, managing resources, and expectation alignment in international and national collaborations across multiple stakeholders. In particular, the EU project RADICAL, my work in Smart Aarhus, and organizing conferences have provided valuable lessons and experience in project management, stakeholder alignment, frequent check-ins, coordination, and the importance of appreciative and productive communication.\nI am familiar with a large selection of project and project methodologies, from agile methods (e.g. SCRUM) to more formalized approaches like (PRINCE2, LEAN and public IT-process frameworks). I have taught approaches to project management and agile software development for years, including approaches that focus on risk management, quality assurance, estimation challenges, and evaluation.\nMy management experiences include managing teaching assistants in my courses. This involves coordination meetings, staffing, coaching on student feedback and classroom management, and developing plans and instructions for them to carry out in their class sessions. In addition, I have supervised 50+ student teams in their course projects, and bachelor and master thesis work. This includes project and code review, helping them scope and prioritize tasks, identifying technical challenges, providing input and advice on their collaboration with external stakeholders, and dealing with various challenges related to deadlines, team dynamics, technical competencies, and communication.\n\n\nCommunication skills\nI have strong communication skills in both Danish and English. I have experience with scientific communication, technical writing, and developing documentation, tutorials, scenarios, user stories, models, and materials for a wide range of processes and projects.\nI frequently write technical tutorials for multiple levels, e.g. supporting students in deploying with Docker on a VM somewhere in the cloud or developing diagrams and illustrations that can explain complex technical concepts. I have researched collaborative writing, information visualization, and the role various representations (text, sketches, models, user stories) play in software development and elsewhere.\nOne of my favorite approaches is to combine communication strategies and utilize various representations, from data visualizations to sketches and narratives, to communicate ideas and challenges. A large part of my teaching and supervision is to help students train their academic as well as technical writing."

    "title": "Conversation about HCI interdisciplinarity, its ‘core’, pedagogy and being kicked around by technology",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: This is a repost from the Medium post for archival purpose and to play around with the format.\nThis post is an attempt to summarise a conversation between Stuart Reeves and Henrik Korsgaard that took place in Aarhus, Denmark, on the 2nd of November 2022. Our discussion was broadly animated by a couple of concerns. Firstly, the long-running conversation in HCI about its ‘status’ (as a field, as a discipline, as a respectable pursuit within the academic superstructure) and its constitution (as an un-/non-discipline and as concerns its interdisciplinarity). And secondly, the overall feeling of what it’s like being ‘kicked around’ by technology, which we sensed much of HCI (and other fields) have experienced for a long time (including ourselves). The conversation is depicted here as a series of turns between Henrik and Stuart but this is mainly for the purposes of presentation. In reality, Henrik initiated some notes, and Stuart then provided further commentary on the notes.\nHenrik: What do we mean by theory and why do we need it? There are two challenges here. First, pedagogy (the second being collective memory within our field, I will return to that). What do you teach from HCI research within a CS program? While there are many available textbooks, they are often design and technology centric and do not constrain a strain or common core of HCI theories. I jokingly say that there are more pictures of technology in our textbooks than references to evidence-based research and theory. Other fields have classics that present how the discipline or field developed and used to think about particular matters. They are still taught either as an introduction to more complex ideas or as part of becoming a member of a particular discipline. A typical example is that we are still teaching Newtonian ideas as partly introductory (because they are accurate enough for most people) and as understanding the history of physics, before progressing to more complex stuff. We also discussed parallels to psychology that also engage with old ideas in classics (see Green, 1997) as a background to understanding traditions and more recent ideas. Thomas Kuhn (1970) talks a lot about textbooks as a way to understand current paradigm of a particular field, as a source of authority, and when there is a paradigm shift, they retain some of the history of the field and a sense of discipline:\n“Textbooks thus begin by truncating the scientist’s sense of his discipline’s history and then proceed to supply a substitute for what they have eliminated. Characteristically, textbooks of science contain just a bit of history, either in an introductory chapter or, more often, in scattered references to the great heroes of an earlier age. From such references both students and professionals come to feel like participants in a long-standing historical tradition.” (Kuhn, 1970, p. 137)\nI guess, what I am missing here is not only a technology-centric history and/or tradition (remember, Grudin (1990) “The Computer Reaches Out” is about interfaces and not the theories and concepts used to make sense of these changes).\nStuart: We started this discussion initially because of your immediate practical concerns about teaching. I think I faced similar fundamental problems (and reflections on ways to move forwards with these problems) when teaching an introductory HCI module some time ago. Teaching HCI leads you to question how the mass of complexity of a whole research field’s work gets packaged up in a ‘textbook’ way for students. This then makes you wonder “what is at the core of HCI and how stable, substantial, and consistent is it?”“. You think”why aren’t there these books that everyone knows in common which I can point to as eternal features of a shared intellectual landscape?““. The first question that springs to mind is whether the ‘textbook’ view of research is similar to or representative of the lived experience of it as part of a community of researchers? Are we fooling ourselves into dreaming of a thing that never was? It is true that there are probably fewer ‘classic texts’ which can provide the level of ongoing intellectual nourishment that other fields benefit from. But maybe this is a function of the technology driving things rather than ideas driving things? The second thing that this conversation here assumes (or at least doesn’t draw attention to) a certain intellectual arrangement of universities, institutions etc. that have a history of specific ways of interrogating and arranging things like ‘disciplines’. HCI and its pedagogy, its forebears, the institutional and cultural situation it finds itself in is a product of that environment and the cultures it has emerged from (many of which are rightly being challenged today). The third thing to mention is that SIGCHI has had an Education Task Force for some time, and EduCHI is now a thing. There’s been prior work here e.g., started by Jenny Preece, Anne Bowser and Elizabeth Churchill some time ago (Churchill et al., 2013). I’m not sure how this conversation connects with that (yet). Finally I want to say that the go-to analogy is physics and we reach for it immediately here. I don’t think you are implying that there is somehow some commensurability, but rather the general perceived sense of ‘stability’ is an important component of the trouble sensed with HCI. I characterise this as ‘trouble’ but we should remember that trouble is not necessarily there to be ‘solved’ (see Reeves & Beck, 2019).\nYou also mention discipline. But there are many basic things which HCI researchers do not agree upon or align on. To me the only points of agreement (and maybe even this is wrong) is that HCI is ‘about’ technology (usually interactive in some way) and design. The rest is up for discussion. Even notions about ‘interactivity’ are themselves in question. Further, as you point out, the history of HCI shapes both its biases, its homes, and its relationships to pedagogy (and cultural differences therein). In the UK, my understanding is that HCI is mostly (mostly!) in a strong relationship with computer science, psychology, human factors, and perhaps also mathematics. There are few historic routes in the UK to HCI that I know of which have come via communication studies, for example, that we see elsewhere like the USA. Maybe Europe is the same? This then informs the shape of HCI in the UK, its recruitment, its structure, organisation, funding models, outcomes, etc. These are choices that have been made bit by bit and yet their broader import and cultural significance with respect to ‘the discipline’ is often not foregrounded or remarked upon much.\nHenrik: We touched upon recent discussions circulating around the lack of common motor themes in HCI (Kostakos, 2015; Liu et al., 2014) and tensions and challenges from being an interdisciplinary field (Blackwell, 2015; Reeves, 2015). The keyword analysis of Liu et al. (2014) - and relatedly, Kostakos (2015) - and the reported the lack of “motor themes” may be methodologically misdirected, but they point to something that is missing in HCI research (see also Oulasvirta & Hornbæk, 2016). What the missing component is, is open. Even the question whether HCI needs some common core or motor themes is debatable. I guess what I feel is missing (and it is a feeling and experience, not something I can firmly back up) is something enduring whether we call it classics, motor themes (based on something else than keywords), theory, concepts, canonical examples for textbooks (again, Kuhn would say that a paradigm in textbooks do not separate the theory from the canonical examples from the canonical exercises). Here, I come back to the question of theory. To me, theory plays an important role as a field or disciplines collective memory. It saves the phenomenon between the concrete and the abstract. It helps us avoid the ‘nomadic’ life Kostakos presents. And it can help us repeat work, perpetually starting from first principles etc.\nStuart: I dislike the scientism of Kostakos and Liu et al. and the method; there are fairly obvious possible ‘cores’ (subcommunities, shared interests, common orientations, etc.) one could easily point to, simply by being a researcher involved in HCI for enough time. Pretending that we cannot do that unless it is part of a ‘scientific analysis’ is to my mind extremely limiting. I also think that the notion of ‘accumulation’ - unstated but nevertheless runs through our discussion - needs to be reflected upon as a ‘science norm’ which may be based on a specific ‘picture’ of research activity (see Feyerabend (1975), and Kuhn of course). And being reflective scholars we should be cognisant of the manner of our investigations too (the big E word, i.e., ‘epistemology’). Thus, treating HCI unreflectively as compared with a picture of ‘normal science’ isn’t really a useful way to think about what HCI could possibly be / be doing. That said, the ‘trouble’ Kostakos and many others seem to feel is nevertheless genuinely felt even if the mode of dealing with it is - in my mind - misguided. I’d also add that the whole discourse on this ‘meta HCI’ stuff - how we each think about our research and what doesn’t get put into papers - is nevertheless vital to properly understand HCI. This stuff is not in the research record. These are more like ‘pub debates’ i.e., things left for the interstitial moments of research life - after all, research is communities of practice too. To not acknowledge that is to ignore a huge chunk of the mundane reality of research activity, just as it is to ignore its many political or cultural aspects.\nYou suggest that theory may be described as collective memory. It may be that HCI does actually ‘do’ what people would comfortably call ‘theory’, yet does not label it as such. Thus by foregrounding particular things (application, domain, technology, etc.) we may be missing what are actually aspects that do act as a ‘core’ for some people (i.e., reframing things dissolves the perceived ‘problem’). This goes back to HCI’s attitudes towards technology - and the tail wagging the dog. HCI’s beholdenness to tech may disguise parts of its collective programme that are actually substantially contributing to ‘theory’, thus also feeding into the concerns about ‘theory’ and ‘cores’. Finally, I note that some years ago there were increased challenges to the role of corporations at CHI, such as industry sponsorship and so on. I wonder how the specific US (and European) biases of CHI and the structures, organisations of things that this bias has maybe promoted contribute to a kind of atmosphere where the ‘core’ becomes a problem. Here we loop back to a critique familiar to us all of which focus on specific ways of knowing, of which a concern for ‘theory’ features heavily.\nHenrik: We often have to repeat and account for aspects of methodology, epistemology, traditions and theoretical orientations that we feel should be somewhat established now, 50 some years into HCI research. There is a sense that, given the strong commitment to design (implications) and informing HCI practitioners, years of insights remain local to particular topics and individual studies. This may also be unevenly distributed, in the sense that user studies and laboratory experiments feel more established than for instance ethnomethodological work and theoretical work.\nStuart: As Taylor (2015) has argued, there is a particular “default mode” of HCI which he calls “Engelbartian interaction”. This means some things are left unexplicated because that is just ‘normal HCI’. Other approaches have to be constantly justified because they breach various unstated norms and taken-for-grantedness. We could connect this back to our discussion about the history of HCI, geographic distribution, etc., and how that particular path or set of paths taken by different communities has led us to this point. At this moment since you mention it we should also talk practice and practitioners, particularly HCI’s relationship to ‘them’ (as a monolith) and industry. Often I think industry doesn’t care much about HCI even though HCI wants its love to be sent to ‘the practitioners’. This relates back to your point about ‘classic texts’ and pedagogy. Our impacts in HCI are very heavily on practitioners but probably not in any direct sense HCI typically conceives as ‘for practitioners’. We collectively train many of them in our degree and masters programmes - this is real, but long-term impact which takes career lengths to actually come to fruition. If we teach them in a way that renders HCI research inchoate and (for want of a better word) ‘scatty’, or subject to the whims of technology and its market infrastructures, then what long-term, deeper orientations are we leaving them with for the rest of their lives when things no doubt change? Will we just leave them chasing surfaces - vagaries of technologies - and not underlying concepts?\nHenrik: So, back to that which may be missing. We cannot pinpoint directly what is missing, but some enduring constructs, synthesis work and a more grounded understanding of the full range of HCI methodology seem to be what the conversation lingers around. I suggest that theory should step into this space as something enduring (that is the role theory has played in other fields). It is striking that contemporary contributions still lament that the field cannot account for basic phenomena (Hornbæk & Oulasvirta, 2017) or the state of these constructs (Reeves & Beck, 2019). Again, the missing bit or hole in HCI research creates trouble for the field. Internally, because it is hard to synthesise work into teachable constructs, compare decades of effects proven in the lab, themes from the field and ideas. When other areas look to HCI research for answers, models and principles, it is unclear to us where they should look and what they will find.\nStuart: You raise a point about appearances, not only practical problems introduced by the needs of pedagogy (and the specific structures / arrangements / assumptions within that sits, situated within - in our limited experience - (specific) European contexts) - but also issues of respectability, how HCI ‘looks’ to others outside of HCI. It should be the case that we can openly talk about how these typically unvoiced concerns may play a role in the discussion here, and the drives towards producing what you call “the enduring”.\nHenrik: Yes, and not only respectability. Depending on how one counts, HCI is a field with 50+ history and work (I typically count from Licklider (1960), because I like the paper. Others might count from the first CHI conference). So when other areas encounter challenges, they may look to us for answers - theories, constructs, guidance. There are many contemporary challenges where we face problems that HCI and CSCW should have some textbook answers to. The massive and hastily migration to remote work under COVID19 for instance. Where are the synthesis insights, models, recommendations, theories for designers and engineers at Zoom, Gathertown, Discord, Slack, Miro to scrutinise to develop better support for everything remote? People working on remote work prior to COVID19 often had problems convincing reviewers of the relevance.\nOr with the increased trend of having prompt-based command line interactions with ML models (so-called prompt-based learning), where is the synthesis (and continued) work on command line interaction? Similarly, work on Human-AI collaboration in Nature seems to have ignored both HCI and CSCW (e.g. Dafoe et al., 2021; Reverberi et al., 2022). Maybe they had a quick look and concluded they were better off starting from scratch. Or when Infovis started to look at interaction as important, it seems like they had to do a first-principle approach instead of learning from HCI (see Yi et al. 2007). And what about newcomers to HCI? If you cannot easily get ‘some’ overview over ‘some’ parts of HCI without having to read Grudin, Bødker, Rogers, Shneiderman and multiple others in parallel, how do you contribute? Or rather, when Rogers says “anything goes in HCI research” (Rogers, 2012, p. xii), then it’s hardly surprising that people skip the classics to go for the quick contribution.\nWhile it is difficult to confidently and conclusively pin-point that something specific is missing, it is much easier to examine some of the reasons for the absence of more enduring constructs or commonly known HCI classics.\nStuart: On this point, there are papers which do try to do ‘meta theory’ or construct ‘meta taxonomies’ to arrange HCI work in response to these concerns about “enduring constructs”. Papers immediately that spring to mind are Turnhout et al. (2019) and Stolterman & Beck (2022), and various papers by Hornbaek & Oulasvirta. Sometimes HCI textbooks try to do this implicitly by virtue of their way of arranging HCI into something ‘readable’. But the central problem facing this task is that of incommensurability. In other words, I think HCI is just the community interface where we share ideas, but owing to HCI’s non-disciplinary nature, the ways we come to those ideas cannot come under some shared schema no matter how ‘meta’. That said, if we re-frame efforts to construct a ‘meta theory’ of HCI into something seemingly less grand but far more practical like ‘a tourism guidebook’ then we may benefit from the things which that analogy entails. Guidebooks try to be accurate but they do not present a grand theory of a city or other tourist destination. Guidebooks get out of date, but they still retain value, and even may provide historical significance some time later. They contain impressions and opinions on ways to engage with the location of interest, but they are not the only way to get value. They try to boil down complexity into something manageable. That said, the notion of the ‘HCI guidebook’ is still a bit different to your idea of ‘classics’.\nHenrik: I like the idea of a HCI guidebook for now. I do believe that there is a space for more theory and more pluralistic theory. And your point on incommensurability is key here. Right now I think that the HCI theory space suffers more from meaning variance and lack of well-described positions and constructs. Once some of this synthesis and theorising work develop more clearly, then, we can explore common philosophy of science issues as they face us. Incommensurabilities and other issues feel like a downstream topic and an entirely different conversation.\nHenrik: Kostakos (2015) identifies the strong focus on implications for design as problematic. We share that focusing on ‘HCI practitioners’ as a primary audience for direct research results is perhaps a bit of a misunderstanding in the field. Typically, one would expect that practitioners of a field get their knowledge and ideas from textbooks and lectures, and not through shifting through CHI proceedings for ‘strong concepts’ and ‘implications for design’. If we rely (only) on synthesising our knowledge as implications for design, these insights will suffer in multiple ways: They will likely remain local to particular research publications We have no tradition of or systematic ways of comparing insights (like other fields compare results, models and theories) They are likely (seen as) valid only to particular technologies or classes of technologies. And unless we are mistaken and the main readership of CHI proceedings is busy HCI folks in industry, then the most recognised epistemological construct in HCI research does not have an audience\nThis brings us to a final summary of the sense of something missing and/or why something is missing. We largely feel that HCI research is getting kicked around by technology. This is perhaps Kostakos’s point as well, but his analogy with nomads feel inadequate to our experiences. For the inventive part of HCI research, new technologies may bring excitement and opportunities for riding a new wave of novelty, relevance, funding and contributions. For us, the experience is different. One does not have to read that much outside HCI before the idea that ‘new’ technologies are rarely new (history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes; history of infrastructure and bureaucracy and computing and all that jazz). Except for a few radical inventions, technology is only new when deliberately positioned in an “we live in unprecedented times” / epochalism narrative (Morozov, 2013). Hence, the fascination with the ‘new’ often becomes an instance of having to relate to the ‘new’ in our own publications, funding proposals, institutions etc., while we at the same time must resist the temptation to critiquing the new, which distracts us from our own research.\nThe way we put technology front and centre in publication titles is another way we are being kicked around by technology. (And this is perhaps where Kostakos’s keyword analysis is hitting the actual problem.) Putting specific technologies (social media), specific instances of technologies (Facebook) or the catchy names of our own inventions in paper titles seem counterproductive to developing enduring constructs and classics that can speak to more than the latest technologies. We are hiding a lot of the contributions to our collective knowledge (whatever that is) in the deep end of our publications. How can you pick up an idea, theory, concept, implication etc. and engage productively with it, if finding things that speak to each other is almost impossible?\nStuart: To that I would add that while there are strong pockets of work within HCI that are definitely ‘kicking back’ at technology, almost everything seems to be working against us doing this. There is only a relatively small amount of work questioning the largely corporate-driven and individualist basis of most technologies that get play in HCI. I can point the finger directly at myself included in this regard - recently we have had a number of relatively successful studies of voice interfaces (e.g. Porcheron et al., 2018) - but you could quite reasonably critique this style of work as essentially glorified (albeit sceptical) product research. Much HCI is like this, unquestioning of the technical fundamentals which underpin and form core assumptions, even when this work is designated ‘critical’. Maybe I shouldn’t be so hard on this work - it is not unreasonable to explore the objects, infrastructures, systems in the world as you find them. Social computing has done a roaring trade in that. But, alternatives, different arrangements of and conceptions of technology seem to be rumbling there under the surface all the time. By that I mean state-, civic-, or community-oriented technologies - although considered in HCI’s body of work - nevertheless have this extant substrate to work with (devices, infrastructures), the assumptions of which - largely privatised, and individualised - bring their own difficulties when retooling for these alternate purposes.\nHenrik: I would like to make a final (post-conversation) note on some of these issues. It doesn’t have to be this way. There are multiple open questions and ambitions to work toward. I do not think that theory should replace anything, but I would also like to be able to work just on HCI theory as a more creative and indigenous genre of HCI contributions. CHI puts up a high bar for theory contributions. A high bar that does not leave room for creativity and experimentation with indigenous theory. Similarly, it is not given that HCI should maintain its fascination and uncritical stance toward industry or the very idea that HCI practitioners and companies are the sole or primary audience for HCI research. Finally, briefly returning to the question of discipline, interdiscipline or speciality. This is not given either. I think it is important to remember that when we give HCI attention in our educational programs and courses, we are also bringing up a new generation of researchers who may feel that this is more a pluralistic (inter)discipline than a meeting between multiple disciplines.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBlackwell, A.

    "text": "A common challenge in software development is to identify and prioritize features in a feature system. Sometimes there are requirements, to begin with, but they are often defined as high-level specifications, and often technical. The important details of the functions and features as they are presented to and used by future users are typically vaguely defined and negotiable. In this specification, they are also underinformed in terms of what the future users need and want.\nIdentifying requirements or specifications of what users need to do their work successfully, or just what would improve existing user experiences is a very hard challenge within software engineering, human-computer interaction, and in practically any project developing software; it is also a very deep challenge because of fundamental issues with problem framing and the nature of problems. Some problems can be well-defined (given sufficient work, knowledge, and information), but people may be reluctant to do so because it requires effort1, whereas others are hard to define or resist a single definitions2. Agile and iterative design approaches is very much a response to this challenge. We cannot specify the system to its fullest up front, so we need to be responsive and make changes as we know more. Even Royce recognizes this in his original paper on the waterfall model.\nRegardless of the challenge, projects need to progress and systems need to be implemented and delivered. Someone needs to drive the work of moving from loosely defined specifications to getting sufficient details to design and develop the right features in the right order. This is the sharp edge of the challenge – we need to go get information, and the best way to do that is to go and ask people. This is the essence of user research3."

    "text": "User Research: Who do we talk to then?\nButton and Sharrock (2021) propose a couple of maxims to guide doing user research. The first one is most relevant here: Keep Close to the Work: ``The first rule of doing ethnographic work in workplaces is to be with the people who are doing the work’’. This means that if you have to build software for tracking and managing component quality in a manufacturing company, then you go talk to the people at the manufacturing company. If you are tasked with developing a system for archiving and handling documents within a public organization doing casework, then you go and talk to the case workers. If you are making scheduling applications for kindergartens or hospitals or an NGO organizing volunteer work you go and visit kindergartens, hospitals, and NGOs and talk to the people there (not all at once, as that would overload you and the project with potentially diverging information).\nThat’s will bring you halfway there. If you just go and spend time within the domain and talk to people, you will learn so much more than you bargained for and have enough to challenge ingrained assumptions that could potentially sabotage the project. The next question is, who do you talk to then? Here, I would like to introduce two analytical (theoretical) perspectives that might guide you. They can be applied individually or in combination."

    "section": "Become an insider and learn from the regulars",
    "text": "Become an insider and learn from the regulars\nAs software developers or user researchers we are often outsiders and the people we want to learn from are insiders. Edward Relph has written about the outsider-insider challenge from a place perspective in “Place and Placelessness”4. Here the outsiders are people unfamiliar with a particular place and insiders are people familiar with a place. Familiarity is equally fluent – you can be familiar with a place you have not visited through reading, media, and/or by visiting similar places. This suggests considering user research as engaging with a place where the activities of interest happen.\nFirst advice: Go there – you have to experience the place to understand and contextualize useful features.\nRelph discusses how our familiarity with a place is a matter of insiderness, and consequently, our lack of understanding is a matter of being outside. As software developers or designers, we are very much outsiders to the particularities of a domain, practice, use, users etc.5.\nRelph makes a continuum of outsiderness to insiderness that is relevant for us. From this we can identify where we are (likely outsiders) and whom we should talk to gain knowledge from an insider:\n\nExistential outsider\nObjective outsider\nIncidential outsider\nVicarious insider\nBehavioural insider\nEmpathic insider\nExsistential insider\n\nThe first and last – existential outsider/insider – are not crucial for us. They merely point out that there is some knowledge and experiences that are so deep and existential that only those who experience it can experience it. You have experiences that nobody else can truly connect with, comprehend, and experience. And people have experiences that you will never be able to comprehend or experience. On a more simple level, we typically cannot connect fully with the experiences of people within other groups and demographics (gender, ethnicity, culture, religion, sexual orientation). At best, we can recognize that people experience the world differently and acknowledge their experiences with sympathy and empath.\nObjective and incidental outsiders are two types of outsiderness where we do not understand the simple aspects of a practice, place, user experience, etc. If we visit a company that produces products or services that we have had very knowledge of or interaction with, or maybe are even surprised to exist. Very few of us know the details of the procedures of the legal system, a heart transplant, or what happens to our trash once we throw it in the bin. Objective outsiderness is when we do not care – it’s just another job and surely a scheduling system for a kindergarten should not diverge that much from a scheduling system for a hospital. Incidental outsiderness is when we make the same assumptions unconsciously.\nSecond advice: Don’t be an objective outsider – embrace that we all are incidental outsiders in many situations.\nThird advice: Avoid talking to outsiders about important practices and activities – this might include parts of management and other stakeholders in the project.\nVicarious insider is a sort of middle ground between being an outsider and being an insider. On the one hand, vicarious insiders are curious outsiders who actively seek information about a particular domain or practice through written accounts, documents, media, and other sources of information. On the other hand, vicarious insiders try to get the knowledge they need through second-hand accounts, which only present partial information that is often outdated or does not reflect what happens in a particular practice. Relph compares it to reading travel books instead of traveling. I bet that a lot of software projects are plagued with vicarious insiders that know enough to navigate a domain, but always fail to get it just right because they only rely upon superficial sources of information.\nNow we are getting to the folks that you should engage with to understand the work. The behavioral and empathic insiders. Both are people who know the domain, local practices, activities, people, and procedures. A behavioral insider, implied, knows how to behave and participate in the activities, but might lack deep relations and understanding. They know what to do, but not the local variations and history. We all know how to conduct ourselves and successfully navigate a library, but we might not know the local rules or who to talk to about a special subject in a particular library we have not been to before. The empathic insiders would have this kind of knowledge. We all experience being behavioral insiders when we switch education or job. We know how to conduct and perform, but it takes some time for us to get a sufficient understanding of the local practices that empathic and existential insiders have. More importantly, from our perspective as outsiders (or vicarious insiders), everyone in a domain are a behavioral insider. As outsiders, it is hard to identify empathic insiders.\nFourth advice: Talk to the behavioral insiders, but make it a priority to identify empathic insiders"

    "section": "Finding and learning from the lead users",
    "text": "Finding and learning from the lead users\nIdentifying and learning from the emphatic insiders is often discussed as identifying and learning from lead users in design research and innovation studies. I use the emphatic insiders simply because I like the framing better – it is telling about what they know and their relation to practice. Lead user is forever tied to a product or technology, and marketing. So from now on think of lead users as emphatic insiders with a product focus. The challenge is the same – if we want to learn from the lead users, we need to identify who they are. With commercial products, one strategy is to data mine user data and social media, but for most software development dealing with a new system or a new domain or a new context, this is neither viable nor a good strategy6.\nHow do we identify emphatic insiders or lead users in a client organization, domain, or practice?\nWithin organizations and social groups – we call them collectives in a recent publication – some people are more familiar with the work, its history, the technologies, procedures, and the roles and politics of the organization. They are the emphatic insiders in Relph’s terminology, lead users in innovation studies, and more capable peers in activity theory. We all know people that would fit the role and description. We go to them for information, help with navigating a (new) organisation, and get the information we need to do our work. They are the people that are capable of answering questions about the informal structure and nature of tasks and activities; They are the people other people refer to when we ask questions: “You need to talk to Pete – he’s been here for a long time and was part of the restructuring back in 2010.” In software engineering, they are the folks that know and remember obscure details about an old project and codebase because they were part of the initial whiteboard sessions and commits. You already know who they are for your organization – we need to identify these people in the organizations and practices we develop software for.\nPetrovsky, a social psychologist, talk about this behavior as referentiality. The collective (group) establishes a shared informal reference of someone within the group who is more knowledgeable about the activities and everything that entails. Sometimes this individual is recognized through an official role or position within the organization as a leader, mentor, coach, or something else, however, that is not given. This more-capable or knowledgeable peer might be hiding somewhere in the organization because of the informal and social nature of knowledge. They may not be a node in the official organizational diagram, but they will be important nodes in the social graph of an organization. Our research (and experiences from other contexts) show that you do this by asking the members of an organization, community, or collective who they go to if they need information, if the system breaks down, when in doubt, or when they need a second opinion. Surprisingly,\nFifth advice: Ask people who they approach for advice and information within the organization around the central task and/or systems – these are the lead users, empathic insiders, and more capable peers.\n\nA matter of distance and commitment\nUp until now, I have ignored some of the challenges in approaching lead users in user research with client organizations and when developing larger systems. There are several facets to this challenge – some are in the client organization, while others are on software engineering practices and how the development process is organized.\nIf the lead users “hide” in informal social relations and roles within the client organization, and if the project manager in the client organization thinks they are the lead user or have already lined behavioral insiders up as informants, it can be difficult to change the direction of and participants in the user research. This is something that is a challenge for research as well. I have gone through interviews with participants that were volunteered by their manager, while they clearly and self-acknowledged that they were not the best source of information. When possible, we should try to engage with this issue with the client organization, and if it fails, remember that a little goes a long way as Button and Sharrow say. Talking to the lead user is ideal, but we can learn enough to get us started from behavioral and even vicarious insiders. Then when we hit an information void on a particular issue, we can approach the client and illustrate the problem. Sometimes this can motivate more access. Proof of work and implications can often help commit resources.\nSixt advice: Take the information you can get and use it to illustrate where and why you need more precise and updated information.\nOne of the biggest challenges is the overreliance on existing assumptions and outdated knowledge within software projects. Because a lot of activities have superficial resemblances and we as humans tend to jump to conclusions, it is so tempting to rely on superficial understandings and ingrained assumptions. This is dangerous in combination with project organizations that are operating at a distance, with the wrong participants from the client organization, and with too many layers of abstraction, communication, and interfaces between the future users and the developers.\nSeventh advice: Assume you act on partial information and recognize when and where you are an outsider!\nSuchman talks about accountability and distance in her essay on “Located accountabilities in technology production”. She points out that software engineering often works across organizational and disciplinary boundaries (think client organization and domain) and that introduces a distance that is maintained both by software engineering practices, clients limiting access to the users, and organizational issues in how software development is organized. For software development, Suchman’s point is that design is done from “nowhere” with “detached intimacy”. That is, from Relph’s perspective, maintaining an objective outsiderness. Instead, Suchman argues that the only way to overcome this is to engage with the collective knowledge of the particular locations of design (software engineering project) and use (client organization and users). The collective knowledge as Suchman says is what Even’s talk about in establishing a shared language in Domain Driven Design and what Participatory Design calls mutual learning. My addition would be the understanding that this learning process is what moves us from outsiders to partial insiders, and in that, the relations with the client organization and practitioners are of utmost importance.\nEight and final advice: See any project you engage with as a learning process where you have to become an expert on the challenges, needs, and experiences of the client organization and whoever will end up using the software you are building!"

    "text": "What happens when you do a project with me?\nBelow are some details on the different genres of projects I typically supervise, the process and some details on my approach to supervision.\n\nChosing an approach\nWhen doing a project, it is important to consider which approach to take. This will determine the kind of project, required steps and outcomes, how the work is evaluated and assessed, and the activities that will take priority in the project. I supervise three different types of projects or combinations thereof. If you have taken the course I teach on Experimental Systems Developement, the approches should be familiar:\n\nExperimental prototyping: Develop and evaluate tools and techniques for X\nDesign project: Involve users (U) in exploring and designing a prototype on X for U\nEmpirical research: Study X within a specific context and activity\n\nFor experimental prototyping, you will spend time reading related work, developing various experimental prototypes (Floyd 1984) and evaluate these in a user study (MacKenzie 2012). This involves designing the study and analysing the qualitative and quantitative results.\nFor design projects, you will have to recruit a group of users and go through a full design project with workshops and iterations toward a final prototype (Bødker et al. 2022). This can be evaluated through a user study, a qualitative analysis or through how the participants responded to the process and design.\nFor empirical research, you will have to identify an appropriate domain and work-related context to study (Button and Sharrock 2009). This typically involves studying how people work with X, their activities, tools and challenges using qualitative research methods. You will spend time doing field work, identifying appropriate ways of analysing the insights and develop rich descriptions and/or design implications.\nSome projects combine elements from the above. Every project develop differently.\nFor data-centric projects exploring interaction techniques, I recommend chosing a startning point from each perspective below:\n\nA step in the data analysis process: discovery, exploration, wrangling, analysis and/or presentation\nA genre of interaction techniques: traditional user interface, visual programing or interaction, physicalizations, sketching, colleborative, natural language, embodied interaction etc?\nData set/platform: traffic-, weather-, energy-, statistical-, cultural-, political-, bibliographic or other data.\n\n\n\nDeveloping the problem statement\nThe first step is to develop a problem statement. I follow the approach outlined in the book “Craft of Research” (Booth et al. 2016) on moving from topics to questions to problems (section II). Before we start the project, I will guide you in and ask you to write a short half/full page synopsis outlining the project. The synopsis should contain the following elements:\n\nTitle\nMotivation\nProblem-statement\nMethodology\nPlan\nShort literature review\n\nThis sounds like a lot, but it should not be. It is a sketch (but not incoherent or unclear) of the project. It should not contain answers, but questions and ideas about where to start informing these questions. The intention is to help you identify the following:\n\nWhat is the current focus of the project?\nWhy (do you think) this is important?\nWhat is the methodology and plan for the project?\nWhat do you know right now?\nWhat do you not know right now – what are the important questions and steps?\n\nThis helps us identify the starting point of the project. And more importantly, if you cannot write a short synopsis on something you intend to spend a semester on – how are you going to complete the project and write up the final assignment?\n\n\nProject and supervision\nYou will start the project from the synopsis. The task is to expand it into a full assignment that can be evaluated and graded towards the end. This has to happen in parallel with the project activities (the prototyping, design project or empirical work) to ensure that the document is updated and grows as you start honing in on the problem and begin to find answers.\nI will be stressing working on writing on the synopsis and paper througout the project, because I so often see students spend all the time on prototyping or designing, and then forgetting to document and update the project. Remember, the reason why you prototype, design or study people is to inform the final report. We cannot grade you on code or designs alonge. You cannot write a good final assignment in the final week (where you are also finishing up other activities).\n\nProcess and milestone\nWhen I supervise there are certain milestones I encurage the students to follow (see table 1 below). It is important to write stuff down when you can and not when you have to; it is important that the right steps inform the next steps. Within the first couple of weeks, you should be ready to start drafting:\n\nIntroduction and problem statement\nRelated work\nMethodology section\n\nDepending on the chosen approach, additional milestones include:\n\nConstructive: Describing the prototype / implementation\nConstructive: Describe the study design\nEmpirical / design: Describe the context, activities and users\nDesign: Document and describe the design process\nEmpirical: Introduce and describe the theoretical / analytical framing\n\nTowards the end, all projects will have to focus on: - Present and analyse results - Discussing what this means for the work, problem statement and the topic\nWe will schedule meetings througout the project following the milestones above, the project needs and where you are in the project.\nWhile projects develop differently, the milestones are important in aligning expectations. It is important that you start developing the background sections (introduction, related work, methodology) as early as possible. You cannot progress meaningfully before you have an idea of the project focus and background.\n\nTable 1: Project milestone overview – mileage and order may vary depending on project (and ambition level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\nProject type\nProject focus\n\n\n\n\n1\nConstructive\nIdentifying technical setup and resources\n\n\n1\nDesign\nIdentify focus and recrut participants\n\n\n1\nEmpirical\nDevelop methodology and recruit participants\n\n\n1\nM1: All\nDraft introduction, related work/background and methodology\n\n\n2\nConstructive\nFirst “hello world” prototype/demonstrator\n\n\n2\nDesign\nContextual inqury and workshops\n\n\n2\nEmpirical\nField work, analysis and reading\n\n\n2\nM2: All\nUpdate drafts, describe context, activities\n\n\n3\nConstructive\nIdentify prototypes and develop these\n\n\n3\nDesign\nCo-design activities and protyping\n\n\n3\nEmprical\nField work, continued\n\n\n3\nM3:All\nDraft assignment structure and table of contents\n\n\n3\nM3: Constructive\nIdentify and develop study design\n\n\n3\nM3: Design\nIdentify final design and evaluation\n\n\n3\nM3: Empirical\nIdentify analytical themse and theory\n\n\n4\nConstructive\nIterate final prototype, plan and recruit for user study, conduct user study\n\n\n4\nDesign\nDevelop final design and evaluated\n\n\n4\nEmpirical\nFollow-up activities, developing themes, write analysis\n\n\n4\nM4: Constructive/Design\nFinish prototype and evaluation\n\n\n4\nM4: Empirical\nFinish all data collection\n\n\n5\nM5: All\nWRITE, EDIT, WRITE, POLISH\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on expectations\nThere is a clear division of labour and responsibility. The student is responsible for doing the work, bring attention to challenges and barriers, and ask for help with particularities. This includes paying attention to deadlines, deliverables, local rules for student projects etc. My role as a supervisor is to supervise the student and project towards the best possible result.\nMy supervision tend to follow the progression of the work. This also means that if there is a lot of progress, then I am more available for supervision. If you do not make progress, then it is better to cancel a meeting and do the work, than us discussing the lack of progress (unless there are reasons for the lack of progress that you need supervision on)."

    "text": "Data reflect the world and the systems that generate it. A lot of the patterns that can be identified using various analytic methods are not surprising, but quite obvious if looking at the practices producing the data. In many ways, it makes more sense to talk about rhythms and routines when considering patterns in data. The patterns are weak or strong signals, or residue or traces of the people and practices, and not isolated patterns only visible in the data. This note is part about me learning to use D3 to visualize data and part of me trying to figure out if our electricity consumption follows the annual changes in daylight.\n\nData on electricity consumption\nIn Denmark, anyone can download data on their electricity consumption from El Overblik. You can download data for your household meter with a resolution from the year, over month and day, to an hour and even every 15 minutes in some cases. We start with a dataset of my household’s electricity consumption since November 2017 per month. Some wrangling is required to reduce the object and format the data.\n\n\n\nShow the code\n// Loading our data file\ndata = FileAttachment(\"/public/data/el-consumption-days-all.csv\").csv({typed:true}).then(raw => {\n    var lat = 56.16, long=10.20\n    \n    //We want to simplify our objects and translate the values into appropriate formats.\n    //We keep the date and the value\n    raw = raw.filter(o => {\n        var str = o[\"Fra_dato\"].substring(6,10)\n        return o[\"Type\"] === \"Tidsserie\" && str != \"2017\"\n    })\n\n    var days = {}\n\n    raw = raw.map(o => {\n        var dstr = o[\"Fra_dato\"].replace(\" 00:00:00\", \"\").split(\"-\")\n        \n        //Gonna remove the leap year. \n        if(dstr[1] === \"02\" && dstr[0] === \"29\"){\n            return\n        }\n\n        var date = new Date(`${2022}-${dstr[1]}-${dstr[0]}`)\n        \n        if(!days[date]){\n            //Create object for date\n            //Including data on the hours of the day\n            var sun = SunCalc.getTimes(new Date(date), lat,long)\n            var day_hs = sun.sunset.getHours() - sun.sunrise.getHours()\n            //day object to return\n            days[date] = {date: date, kwhs_min:100, kwhs_max:0, kwhs_values:[],kwhs_median:0,kwhs_q_lower:0, kwhs_q_upper:0, day_hs:day_hs}\n        }\n            \n\n        var v = typeof o[\"Mængde\"] == \"string\" ? parseInt(o[\"Mængde\"]) : o[\"Mængde\"]\n        //adding kwhs consumption to the value array and calculate min/max\n        days[date].kwhs_values.push(v)\n        days[date].kwhs_min = v < days[date].kwhs_min ? v : days[date].kwhs_min\n        days[date].kwhs_max = v > days[date].kwhs_max ? v : days[date].kwhs_max\n\n    })\n\n    //Convert days Object to Array\n    raw = Object.values(days)\n    //Sorting dates because the order is messy after conversion from object to array\n    raw.sort((a,b) => {\n        return a[\"date\"] > b[\"date\"]\n    })\n\n    //Calculating medians\n    raw = raw.map(o => {\n        o.kwhs_median = d3.median(o.kwhs_values)\n        o.kwhs_q_lower = d3.quantile(o.kwhs_values, 0.25)\n        o.kwhs_q_upper = d3.quantile(o.kwhs_values, 0.75)\n    \n        return o\n    })\n\n    return raw\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual electricity consumption\nI wanted to plot our annual consumption in a way that followed the calendar year and carried across into the new year.

With the bright summer nights, we need less light and as the days get shorter towards the winter we need more. This assumes that a significant amount of our electricity is consumed by sources that somehow map to this rhythm. Lights are one source, but indoor entertainment (gaming, streaming, television, etc.) would also increase during the winter.\nIt is easy to observe the rhythm of the daylight changes in Figure 1, but the correlation with energy consumption is less obvious. Or rather, the erratic nature of the energy data obscures whatever might be there. It looks like the summer months are slightly below the 10 kwhs line, with the spring and fall months sitting on the line, and the winter months moving slightly above the 10 kwhs line. Turns out that when computing the correlation coefficient (r=0.243, see below), then there is hardly any correlation between daylight and electricity consumption data.\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncorrelation_coeffecient = {\n\n    const kwhs_array = days.map(d =>{\n        return d.kwhs\n    })\n\n    const daylight_array = days.map( d =>{\n        return d.daylight\n    })\n\n    const correlation = simplestats.sampleCorrelation(kwhs_array,daylight_array)\n    return correlation\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile dissapointed that the visualisation does not show a clear pattern, this also hightligt the benefits of visualising the data. While the correlation coefficient tell me that there is no correlation between daylight and electricity consumption, the visualisation (and making it) has a lot of additional benefits:\n\nI am learning useful information about the particular data from crafting the visualisation. Information that is useful for future experiments and visualisations.\nThe visualisation and data forces me to reflect on my hypothesis and look for alternative explanations\nThe visualisation provide hints and information useful for speculating about explanations on the relationship between consumption and annual patterns.\n\n\n\nSo, why does our annual electricity consumption not correlate with available daylight?\nThe hypothesis assumes that a significant amount of our electricity consumption goes to sources that decrease with an increase in available daylight and increase when it gets darker outside during the winther. That would mostly be electrical lights and indoor entertainment. First, I do not think that lights account for a significant amount of our consumption. This would go to refriguation, laundry and cooking. On top of that, most of our indoor lighting is LED based which consume only a few watts per unit per hour and our use of entertainment likely only changes marginally from summer to winther. I still play computer games and we still stream during the summer.\nThis pose an interesting question. We are often told that private consumers should change habits and implement various micro-initiatives as part of solutions toward the climate and energy crisis. While some initatives do work, the savings seem minimal. My guestimate is that we can properly optimize our consumption to save a couple of kilowatts per day at most. A lot of our consumption is not something we can change at the moment. We still need a freezer and refrigerator, and we need to cook meals. A lot of larger initiatives do not make economic sense. So, is it even possible to optimize household consumption in a meaningful way so it contributes to lowering the energy demand? I do not think so. Not without heavy economic incentives. I will try to explore everyday habits, theoretical savings and impact in a future post.\n\n\nShow the code\nsimplestats = require(\"simple-statistics@7\")\n// Loading our data file\ndays = FileAttachment(\"/public/data/el-consumption-days-all.csv\").csv({typed:true}).then(raw => {\n    var lat = 56.16, long=10.20\n    \n    //We want to simplify our objects and translate the values into appropriate formats.\n    //We keep the date and the value\n    raw = raw.filter(o => {\n        var str = o[\"Fra_dato\"].substring(6,10)\n        return o[\"Type\"] === \"Tidsserie\" && str != \"2017\"\n    })\n\n    raw = raw.map(o => {\n        // Create a data object\n        var dstr = o[\"Fra_dato\"].replace(\" 00:00:00\", \"\").split(\"-\")\n        var date = new Date(`${dstr[2]}-${dstr[1]}-${dstr[0]}`)\n      \n        //Create object for date\n            //Including data on the hours of the day\n        var sun = SunCalc.getTimes(new Date(date), lat,long)\n        var daylight = (sun.sunset - sun.sunrise) / 1000 / 60\n\n        var v = typeof o[\"Mængde\"] == \"string\" ? parseInt(o[\"Mængde\"]) : o[\"Mængde\"]\n\n        return {date: date, kwhs:v, daylight:daylight}\n    \n    })\n\n    //Sorting dates because the order is messy after conversion from object to array\n    raw.sort((a,b) => {\n        return a[\"date\"] > b[\"date\"]\n    })\n\n    return raw\n})"
