I'm looking for new opportunities and challenges. I'm interested in positions in software engineering, data-driven projects, product- and service design, and digitization. 

I have loved my time at Computer Science at Aarhus University, but I need new challenges. It has been an exciting and incredible ride, but every time I have visited collaborators and folks outside the university walls, in the software industry, digitization projects, the public sector, and other initiatives, I have been struck with all the amazing projects, talented people, and exciting challenges. Now I would like to try out the challenge â€“ see how far my skills and experience can bring the projects I engage in and contribute to!

If this sounds interesting to you or your organization, then reach out. I would love to connect and have a chat about future possibilities.

I am looking for a role within software engineering with a focus on project development/management, domain-driven design, software architecture, user-centered design, data-driven approaches, and similar. I have a few ideas but am also open to other suggestions, so please reach out.

Here is a link to my [detailed resume.](/notes/full-resume.qmd)

Currently, I'm an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Aarhus University, with human-data interaction as my research focus. I try to understand how to better integrate data into application design, interactive systems, analytics, visualization, and interaction design from an end-user perspective. I research how people use data and explore new tools to support analytics, visualization, and data-driven approaches. I teach experimental system development, design research, user-driven agile software development, co-design, and prototyping. 

I have an MSc in Information Technology on Interaction Design, Open Data, and Smart City technologies. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Aarhus University in Human-Computer Interaction (Interaction Design, User Experience, User-centered design, and design research). My thesis focuses on the theoretical and empirical foundations for location-based services and community software.
