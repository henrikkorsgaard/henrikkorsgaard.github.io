title: "Looking for work"
---

My contract at Aarhus University ends this year. It has been an exciting and incredible ride, but every time I have visited collaborators and folks outside the university walls, in the software industry, digitization projects, the public sector, and other initiatives, I have been struck with all the amazing projects, talented people, and exciting challenges. Now I would like to try out the challenge â€“ see how far can my skills and experience can bring the projects I engage in and contribute to!

If this sounds interesting to you or your organization, then reach out. I would love to connect and have a chat about future possibilities.

I am looking for a role within software engineering with a focus on project development/management, domain-driven design, software architecture, user-centered design, data-driven approaches and similiar. I have a few ideas but am also open to other suggestions, so please reach out.
