I have been visualising energy data for our hoursehold as a way of [experimenting a bit with different visualisation types](/notes/electricity-data-visualisation-experiments.qmd) and trying to see if there is a connection between our electricity consumption and daylight across multiple years. Spoiler -- there is [no correlation (r=-0.24)](/notes/annual-rhythms-in-electricity-consumption.qmd). 

In this follow-up note I will zoom in and look at the weekly and daily patterns in our electricity data.

Todo:

- Days
- Weeks
- Lows and highs
- Theoretical savings
